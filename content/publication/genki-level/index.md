abstract: "I've been thinking about turfgrass growth and the relative degree to which the turf manager is pushing the grass to grow with fertilizer, or is trying to slow the growth from what it could be by withholding fertilizer, for a number of years. In a series of posts from February 2019, all published at www.asianturfgrass.com, I explained how the genki level concept works and its practical applications. This document puts those posts together in pamphlet form"
