MLSN is a modern method for interpreting soil tests for turfgrass. This method is designed to do two things.

1. Prevent nutrient deficiencies by recommending nutrients as fertilizer when they won't be supplied in adequate amounts by the soil.

2. Avoid unnecessary fertilizer applications by identifying soils which can supply enough nutrients to the grass.

The MLSN guidelines were developed in a collaboration between ATC and [PACE Turf](https://www.paceturf.org/), with an introduction in 2012. Since then, MLSN has been used with great success by turfgrass managers all over the world.
