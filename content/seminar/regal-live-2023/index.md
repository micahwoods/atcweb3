### Notes

During the seminar, I mentioned adjusting N rates by checking the actual clipping volume compared with the desired clipping volume. This can be done using the *growth ratio*. The growth ratio can also be used to determine the growth rate for a particular property that is suitable for the amount of traffic across that grass.

For more about the growth ratio, see these posts as an introduction:

* [What should my ClipVol be?](/post/what-should-my-clipvol-be/)
* [The growth ratio equation](/post/the-growth-ratio-equation/)

We also discussed what type of soil organic matter (or total organic material) test results would be too high? For that question, I recommend these posts:

* [How much organic matter is too much?](/post/how-much-om-is-too-much/)
* [Maximum soil organic matter, not minimum, should be the goal](/post/max-om-in-soil-as-a-goal/)
