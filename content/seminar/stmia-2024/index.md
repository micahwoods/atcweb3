### Notes on minimizing disease

See normal levels of leaf nutrients in bermudagrass, seashore paspalum, and zoysiagrass putting green clippings in the "strategies to minimize disease with reduced fungicide use slides."

For more about estimating nutrient harvest by measuring clippings, see [Turfgrass growth ratio, nitrogen harvest, and fertilizer adjustment](/post/growth-ratio-nitrogen-harvest-and-fertilizer-adjustment/).

For more about clipping measurement, see the [clipvol project page](/project/clipvol/) or the [*One Bucket at a Time*](https://micahwoods.github.io/buckets/) book.

### Notes on water use

Article on [mapping fairway soil moisture for improved irrigation decisions at your golf course](https://turf.umn.edu/news/mapping-fairway-soil-moisture-improved-irrigation-decisions-your-golf-course) by Straw and MacKenzie.

Get the [protocol for golf course soil moisture mapping](https://license.umn.edu/product/protocol-for-golf-course-soil-moisture-mapping).

Sifers and Beard (1997) on [bermudagrass vs. zoysiagrass irrigation requirement](https://tic.msu.edu/tgif/flink?recno=213631).

Gouveia et al. on [warm-season turfgrass species quality under drought](https://doi.org/10.1111/jac.12681).

Serena et al. on a [15 to 30% reduction in water use](https://doi.org/10.2134/agronj2018.03.0148) by using trinexapac-ethyl and soil surfactants---without reducing color or quality of bermudagrass.

PACE Turf's [water budget spreadsheet](https://www.paceturf.org/PTRI/Documents/140404_blank_waterbudget.xlsx) is "an easy to use water budget spreadsheet that will estimate how much irrigation water [was expected to be used] at your location. By calculating water budgets for previous years, you can get an idea of whether you are over using irrigation water, or whether you are staying within generally acceptable guidelines."

The image below shows the factors you need to provide. The spreadsheet then calculates the estimated irrigation use.

### Notes on the water droplet penetration test

PACE Turf's [water droplet test video](https://youtu.be/ujtvjFvKPJk?si=adesNtultQ9gRjaO) explains the test and demonstrates exactly how to do it.

My discussion with Bill Kreuser about [wetting agent re-application intervals by growing degree days](https://youtu.be/l_DDlsgnxbU?si=6rOYOMKLmWx457eE).

### Notes on tropical grasses

There's a fascinating article by Jack Murray and Milt Engelke from the USGA *Green Section Record* in 1983: [Exploration for zoysiagrass in eastern Asia](https://gsrpdf.lib.msu.edu/?file=/1980s/1983/830508.pdf). Many of the new varieties of *Zoysia* now coming from the USA are selections from, or the result of breeding from, this collection of material.

* Greg Wiecko's article about [bermudagrass struggling in Asia](wiecko2000.pdf)

* ATC posts about [bermudagrass](/tag/bermudagrass/)

* ATC posts about [zoysiagrass](/tag/zoysia/)

* ATC posts about [seashore paspalum](/tag/paspalum/)

* Bobble test [scale, explanations, and videos](/tag/bobble-test/)
