I especially want to recommend [this blog post](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/whats-the-best-way-to-keep-up/). It lists, and provides links to, the best ways to keep up with what I'm doing.

For the MLSN topic, I recommend ATC's [MLSN page](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/mlsn/) which has links to pretty much anything you might want to find about MLSN, from cheat sheets to FAQs to data and good and an explanatory e-book.

* Download the slides I showed on [Basic & advanced turf nutrition with MLSN](olds-mlsn-2023.pdf), 5 MB PDF file

You can get new information from ATC through our [email newsletters](https://subscribepage.com/atc_newsletters). One of those newsletters is focused only on MLSN and turf nutrition.

For even more information, see:

* The [PACE Turf](https://www.paceturf.org/) information center
* The [ATC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/asianturfgrasscenter)
* The [ATC Doublecut](https://atc-doublecut.transistor.fm/) and the [ATC Office Hours](https://atc-office-hours.transistor.fm/) podcasts.
