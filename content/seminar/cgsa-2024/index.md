### Systematic improvement notes

I started off with this as an introduction:

> For a system of putting surface management, we can start with measuring the playing conditions that are produced. That's going to involve the stimpmeter measurement, possibly an assessment of how smooth the surface is, and perhaps a measurement of firmness as well. These playing conditions happen when the grass that comprises the surface is healthy and resilient enough to tolerate the work that needs to be done to produce those playing conditions. And of course the grass is growing in soil, so the soil must be able to produce this type of grass.

> That is a top down approach, starting with the type of putting surfaces we want to have, then measuring the surfaces to determine if we have achieved those conditions, and recognizing that we need to have resilient grass, and suitable soil conditions, in order to have the desired conditions. Another way to think of this is that if we have the type of soil conditions that allow resilient grass to grow, then the inevitable result will be the desired type of playing conditions on those putting surfaces.

I suggested that the inevitable result when taking a top down approach is systematic improvement, but if we start from the soil, and then the grass, in a bottom up approach, it's not so certain that the playing conditions follow.

We discussed:
