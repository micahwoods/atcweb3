## Notes

You can get new information from ATC through our [email newsletters](https://subscribepage.com/atc_newsletters).

Find turfgrass reference information, site-specific weather and climate appraisals, and weekly updates at the [PACE Turf](https://www.paceturf.org/) information center.

For more about MLSN, see this article by Romain Giraud: [NMND : niveau minimum pour une nutrition durable des greens de golf](https://cliniquedugazon.fr/index.php/2018/10/19/nmnd-niveau-minimum-pour-une-nutrition-durable-des-greens-de-golf/).

## A *Cynodon* question at Saint-Endréol

{{< figure src="st_endreol_gp_2022.png" caption="A slide from the presentation." >}}

At St. Endreol, I showed the C<sub>3</sub> growth potential (GP) (above) and mentioned that I would make a chart and calculate the estimated N rate that might work well for *Cynodon* at that location.

The estimated N that I expect for these temperatures for *Cynodon* is 140 kg/ha (14 g/m<sup>2</sup>). 

## How do I get those N values?

I use maximum monthly N amounts that are linked directly to GP. For bentgrass, I assume that when the GP is 1, the maximum N applied would be 20 kg/ha. That, for *Agrostis*, is with a C<sub>3</sub> GP. For *Zoysia* with a C<sub>4</sub> GP, I also use 20. For *Festuca rubra*, 20, maybe even 15. For *Paspalum vaginatum* and *Poa annua* I use 30. For *Cynodon* and *Lolium perenne* I use 40.

With *Agrostis*, the sum of GP is 207 days. The monthly maximum N I would use is 20, or 240 if all twelve months had perfect temperatures. This is $\frac{240}{365}=$ 0.66 kg/ha/day. If I multiply that daily value by the sum of GP, I get the estimated annual N of $\frac{240}{365}(207)=$ 136 kg/ha. That's for *Agrostis*.

For *Cynodon*, I'm using C<sub>4</sub> GP and a monthly maximum of 40 kg/ha, so the annual total comes to $\frac{480}{365}(108)=$ 142 kg/ha.

## For the mountain courses ...

If you sometimes have winter damage from snow or ice at your location, please consider providing information to the [Winter Turf](https://winterturf.umn.edu/winterturf-data-collection-help-needed-year-3) project.
