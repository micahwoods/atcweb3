I used three sets of slides at this conference. You can download them at these links.

* [MLSN: modern turfgrass nutrition](/seminar/2023-11-helsinki/helsinki-mlsn.pdf)
* [Clipping volume, GP, and nitrogen](/seminar/2023-11-helsinki/helsinki-clipvol.pdf)
* [OM246, organic matter/material, & sand topdressing](/seminar/2023-11-helsinki/helsinki-om246.pdf)

See more about OM246 testing, including sampling instructions and a sample report, at the [OM246 project page](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/project/om246/).

You can get new information from ATC through our [email newsletters](https://subscribepage.com/atc_newsletters).

I mentioned Chris Tritabaugh's Substack newsletter. You can read it, and get a free subscription, at [The ct_turf newsletter](https://ctunderscoreturf.substack.com/).

I mentioned the [MLSN cheat sheet](/post/new-mlsn-cheat-sheet/) having information about converting between soil test methods other than Mehlich 3.

We also discussed some soil testing methods, and the scoop sizes for soil testing. [This video](https://youtu.be/PyL2bfdiBdE?si=xMiTajjgIEsc8gjY) takes a tour through the soils lab at Brookside, and you can see some of the scoops, testing robots, and see all the steps of routine soil nutrient analysis.
