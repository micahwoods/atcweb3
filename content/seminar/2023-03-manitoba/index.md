These are the slides and supplementary links for my presentations at the 2023 Manitoba Golf & Turf Conference.

* Slides on [Systematic improvement of course conditions](systematic_improvement.pdf), 11.5 MB PDF file
* Slides on [Soil organic matter by depth](om246.pdf), 8.6 MB PDF file

I mentioned these articles from the *USGA Green Section Record.*

* [Managing organic matter in putting greens](https://gsr.lib.msu.edu/article/moeller-lowe-managing-11-4-16.pdf) by Adam Moeller and Todd Lowe.
* [A year of measuring putting green performance](https://gsr.lib.msu.edu/article/hartwiger-year-11-1-19.pdf) by Chris Hartwiger.
* [Perfectly True](https://gsr.lib.msu.edu/2010s/2010/100124.pdf) about the Bobble Test measurement of ball roll, by Richard Windows and Henry Bechelet.

On the ATC website you'll find plenty of information about these topics. I'll recommend the [OM246 project page]({{< relref "/project/om246" >}}) as a starting point for the total organic material by depth topic. 

You can get new information from ATC through our [email newsletters](https://subscribepage.com/atc_newsletters). 

[Chris Tritabaugh's newsletter](https://ctunderscoreturf.substack.com/) also discusses many of these topics.
