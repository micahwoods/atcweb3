These apps use weather data from four locations in Thailand, one location in the USA (Corvallis, Oregon), and three locations in the Philippines, to calculate the irrigation water requirement. 

{{< cta cta_text="Irrigation requirement (Thailand & Corvallis)" cta_link="https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/irrigation/" cta_new_tab="true" >}}

{{< cta cta_text="Irrigation requirement (Philippines)" cta_link="https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/irr_ph/" cta_new_tab="true" >}}

The users are able to select the location and then adjust factors that influence the soil moisture content and the irrigation water requirement. These factors include:

* rootzone depth
* field capacity
* minimum soil moisture triggering an irrigation event
* maximum volumetric water content (VWC) to irrigate to
* crop coefficient
* distribution uniformity of the irrigation system

Charts are then generated to show the VWC through the year, given the weather that happened at the selected location, along with the annual irrigation requirement, monthly irrigation requirement, and other interesting summary calculations.
