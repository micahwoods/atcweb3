By looking at the change in total organic matter over time ([OM246]({{< relref "/project/om246" >}})), and at the amount of sand added between two sampling dates, this app can calculate the site-specific organic matter accumulation rate. When this is known, the app can find the exact amount of sand required to produce a specified level of OM in the soil.
