Green speed is defined as

> **ball roll distance**: the distance a ball moves (i) after striking the ground upon termination of its air flight, (ii) as a result of a putting stroke, or (iii) as a result of hand-imparted motion, as in lawn bowling; it can be quantitatively assessed, as by the use of a Stimpmeter on golf greens

This is from Beard, J. B and Harriet J. Beard. 2005. Ball roll distance. p. 40. *In* Beard's Encyclopedia for Golf Courses, Grounds, Lawns, Sports Fields. East Lansing, MI: Michigan State University Press.
