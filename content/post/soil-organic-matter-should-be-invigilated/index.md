I don't recall if I read this exact statement, or if it occurred to me when I read something else about invigilation. What I do know is I had a note in my `blog_post.org` file about organic matter being invigilated. That is, the organic matter content should be watched diligently.

The OM246 trilogy videos explain more about how I would do this.
