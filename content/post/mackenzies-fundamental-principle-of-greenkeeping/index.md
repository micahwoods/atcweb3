I taught two seminars at the 2017 Philippine Golf Course Management conference. 

One was about [MLSN after 5 years](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/mlsn-after-5-years-soil-test-interpretation-for-turfgrass-today). I explained what soil test interpretation is, why the [MLSN guidelines]({{< relref "/mlsn" >}}) were developed, and explained how they work.

The other was about irrigation water requirement. The slides are [here](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/a-precious-resource-irrigation-water-requirement-of-golf-courses), and I made [this Shiny app](https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/irr_ph/) with data from 2013 through 2016 for Manila, Cebu, and Baguio.
