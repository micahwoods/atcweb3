Joe Gulotti's The Talking Greenkeeper podcast is popular all over the world. When I travel, I often meet people who tell me how much they enjoy listening to his show, and some who tell me they first heard of me, or of [MLSN](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/mlsn/), by listening to the show.

I enjoyed another talk with Joe in [this episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/micah-woods-phd-iv/id1435947281?i=1000590700618). We covered a lot: current topics, some of the things I do, some of the places we've been, and some of the people we've met. I hope you'll have a listen.

I also want to recommend that you make sure you are signed up to one or more of the ATC newsletters.

I enjoy listening to The Talking Greenkeeper myself, and it was a great pleasure to be a guest on the show again.
