If you haven't listened to Joe Gulotti's [The Talking Greenkeeper](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-talking-greenkeeper/id1435947281) yet, I recommend starting with [Episode 1 from Season 5, with Frank Rossi as the guest](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/frank-rossi/id1435947281?i=1000579005503).

I've been wanting to listen to that conversation for a few years. Joe managed to put together a podcast [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/the_talking_greenkeeper/), he's had podcast merchandise with the iconic Talking Greenkeeper logo, he recorded four seasons of what has been called the "best podcast in the game," and yet he couldn't get Dr. Rossi on the show. 

Until now.

And I've been talking about turfgrass in two podcasts of my own:
