In the last [ATC update newsletter](/#newsletters) I included a survey about future video topics. These are the results. 

{{< figure library=true src="atc_video_survey.jpg" >}}

Thanks to everyone for the feedback! A topic that has been on my mind and that I want to explain further is N fertilizer and ClipVol. I've called that [flipping things around](/post/flipping-things-around/). I was glad to see that topic has some interest from the newsletter readers. 

But I'm going to work on surface OM and surface firmness first, based on the results of the survey.

And I have good news. If you haven't seen them, a couple videos I've made already cover some of these topics.

- [A continuous improvement system for turfgrass](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/improve) includes a discussion of surface OM and surface firmness.

- [Humbug](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/humbug) is *the* MLSN movie and looks at that topic from all kinds of angles.

- [Leaves of grass](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/clip1) takes a look at measurement of clipping volume.
