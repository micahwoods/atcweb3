Chris Tritabaugh has completed his series of blog posts about playability, organic matter management, change, and consistency, with one titled [What we do](https://ct-turf.medium.com/what-we-do-bc430f38b469). The series started with [Is that disruption?](https://ct-turf.medium.com/is-that-disruption-4d18ffdd9a1d)

I recommend reading these because they describe some surprising results. For example:

> On May 2nd, we applied ... 0.6 mm of topdressing sand. ... This would be the last topdressing sand applied to the greens until the course closed in November 2022.

> 2022 was the third straight summer in which we have applied no, what I would call, regularly scheduled topdressing. I believe it is not a coincidence that during this period, we have experienced zero summer decline.

> it may be natural to think the way we have been maintaining the putting greens may work for a season, or two, but it cannot be sustainable over the long term. I myself would have thought the same, not more than five years ago. It turns out by measuring playability and keeping abreast of any change in the OM at the 0â€“2 cm depth, we can find a sweet spot and know exactly what maintenance practices are and are not necessary.
