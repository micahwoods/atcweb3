It's called [A Short Grammar of Greenkeeping](https://leanpub.com/short_grammar_of_greenkeeping).

The book is not completely new material. It is based on the 14 articles I wrote in a series for *GCM China*, which I realized make a short grammar. I've added a preface, and some additional information in the footnotes, and you should be able to get it in formats to read on any device.
