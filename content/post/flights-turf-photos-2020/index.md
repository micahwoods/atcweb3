This is usually where I show a map with all my flights, mention that they took me some hundred thousands of kilometers, and then share some of my favorite turf photos from all the places I went. 

Well, I'm not bothering with the flight map this year. I took 12 flights and went 16,722 km. It would have been nice to travel more, but reflecting on the year, I have to say it was a nice change to not travel as much as I usually do.

And I still saw some beautiful and interesting turfgrass! Here are ten of my favorite photos from this year.

{{< figure library="true" src="royal_hua_hin_8.jpg" title="The eighth at Royal Hua Hin, January" >}}

Royal Hua Hin was looking especially good in January. This is the oldest course in Thailand.

I visited Japan in February and saw some snow and a few golf courses. The all-zoysia Keya GC---yes, even the greens---was looking great.

{{< figure library="true" src="andaman_dry_lawn.jpg" title="A dry manilagrass lawn on an island in the Andaman Sea, March" >}}

I spent a couple weeks on a small island in the Andaman Sea in March. During the dry season, the lawns on the island were dormant. That makes a striking contrast with the blue water.

This zoysia on the beach was getting a little water and remained green.

{{< figure library="true" src="axonopus_white_temple_mask.jpg" title="Tropical carpetgrass lawn at the White Temple in Chiang Rai, October" >}}

The standard turf for shaded lawns in Thailand is tropical carpetgrass.

{{< figure library="true" src="santiburi_samui_6.jpg" title="Waterfall in full flow on the sixth at Santiburi Samui, December" >}}

It had been raining in Samui. You won't always see this waterfall with so much flow.

{{< figure library="true" src="nikanti_roll_sunrise.jpg" title="Rolling a Tifeagle green at sunrise at Nikanti GC, December" >}}

Nikanti GC is all bermudagrass in Nakhon Pathom just west of Bangkok. It was looking great in the December sunshine.

{{< figure library="true" src="milford_december.jpg" title="The second nine at the rugged and spectacular Hua Hin Korea CC, December" >}}

I had not been to this course (formerly Milford) since 2011. The trees have grown up a lot, and blocked a lot of the views, but it remains a spectacular setting for golf.

{{< figure library="true" src="banyan_3_morning.jpg" title="Morning view of the third at Banyan GC, December" >}}

Speaking of spectacular settings for golf, Banyan GC in Hua Hin has one of the best. This is a morning view. The late afternoon view from the 19<sup>th</sup> hole, Mulligan's Pub, is one of the best in the world. Maybe I can get that picture this year!
