After I wrote about [*no problem* DLI levels]({{< relref "/post/40-30-and-20" >}}), Brandon Horvath asked if I could get DLI for some cities in Tennessee.

For a description of how I made the calculations, see [Estimating daily light integral (DLI) in 4 Tennessee cities](http://www.seminar.asianturfgrass.com/tn_dli_description.html). All the scripts are in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/micahwoods/dli_tn).
