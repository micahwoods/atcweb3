Turfgrass growth is affected by temperature. The temperature-based turfgrass growth potential (GP) is an easy way to look at how the actual temperature is related to the optimum temperatures for growth.

PACE Turf put together [this GP avatar Shiny app](https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/GPAvatar/) to generate a simple plot of cool-season and warm-season grass GP.

There are two options with this app. One can automatically generate avatars for thousands of locations in the USA based on ZIP codes, or one can enter the temperatures for any location.
