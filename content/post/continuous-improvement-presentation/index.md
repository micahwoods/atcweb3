I've recorded a quick video to describe the presentation I delivered at Nutranta's Best Practices seminar last week.

I spoke about a [continuous improvement system for turfgrass](https://youtu.be/3fAk32YYZ3Q).

In the presentation, I mentioned the article [A Year of Measuring Putting Green Performance](http://gsrpdf.lib.msu.edu/ticpdf.py?file=/article/hartwiger-year-11-1-19.pdf) by Chris Hartwiger.

In the video I put together today I rushed through these topics. During the seminar I spoke for a more leisurely 45 minutes about these same things, and then [Andrew McDaniel](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/1198772920258113537?s=20), the greenkeeper and assistant general manager of Keya GC in Japan, spoke about his work.
