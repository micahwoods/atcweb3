Joe Gulotti, host of [The Talking Greenkeeper podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jason-haines-micah-woods-phd/id1435947281?i=1000545661448), invited Jason Haines and I to join him for a fun conversation.

We talked about sustainability, MLSN, OM246, playability, sand topdressing, and a special Christmas for Joe in Arizona. We did not talk about the last time we all met in person, which was at a spectacular conference in Moncton.

I didn't have a chance to mention the article by Wendy Gelernter and Larry Stowell (and me) about [documenting your progress toward sustainability](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/201312_gelernter_et_al_gcm_sustainability.pdf). This article talks about the grass on a golf course, and I think it is a common sense and simple way to think about the resources used to produce golfing surfaces.

I also include here a link to The R&A's [Golf Course 2030](https://www.randa.org/en/sustainability/golfcourse2030) page for those who would like to learn more about that initiative.
