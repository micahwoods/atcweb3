I've written about zoysia growing faster than bermuda. [Mike Richardson asked](https://twitter.com/ArkansasTurf/status/755887394151247872):

> so, the real question...is that better? "Slow growing" has always been one of my favorite traits of zoysia...

I answered that it is better, and that I would explain my hypothesis later. Here it is:

_The most sustainable grass for a given location is the one that has the most growth per unit of N and per unit of H<sub>2</sub>O applied._

Definitions:

  * _most sustainable grass_ is the one that requires the fewest inputs to produce the desired surface
  * _location_ is the temperature and light combination.

Assumptions:

  * one considers all the grasses that could possibly produce the desired surface at that location
  * from those, one selects those that don't die when N and H<sub>2</sub>O are reduced

It follows that of the remaining grasses---by that I mean those that don't die---the one with the fastest growth rate will require the fewest inputs to produce the desired surface, because one can supply low amounts of N and water to that grass. The one with the fastest growth rate also gives the most maintenance options, because one can adjust the growth rate across a wider range.
