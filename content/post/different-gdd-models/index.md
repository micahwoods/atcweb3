Everyone using growing degree days (GDD) in turf management should be sure they are calculating them and working with them in just the right way. This new guide on [the nuance of growing degree day calculations](https://turf.unl.edu/turfinfo/9-28_GDD_Calcs.pdf) from [Bill Kreuser and UNL](https://turf.unl.edu/) explains the calculation and makes sure you have all the information you need:

> "There are subtle differences between the many different GDD models found in turf. Itâ€™s important to understand these differences because they can be the difference between a model working great and being a massive failure."

The [Greenkeeper app](http://www.greenkeeperapp.com/marketing/) is a really useful tool for making sure these calculations are correct.
