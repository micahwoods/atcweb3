I enjoyed reading about [saltmarsh coastal protection work](http://blog.standrews.com/2018/05/14/coastal-protection-work-ploughs-on/) in the Eden Estuary by the St. Andrews Links greenkeepers.

I discovered [two new---to me---research projects about silicon](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-05-20-so-much-silicon-research-i-cant-keep-up-with-it/).

Bill Kresuer showed just how low the soil test needs to be before one will see [P deficiency symptoms](https://twitter.com/UNLturf/status/999656608316747777):

*Golf Digest India* wrote about the [India Golf Expo](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-05-04-you-have-been-featured/) and published one of my articles.

Joe Gulotti [wrote about MLSN](http://www.golfdom.com/insights-from-great-white-north/) and about his first trip to Canada since a 1992 Grateful Dead show in Hamilton. 

Enrico Tobio shows that [MLSN works great for lawns](https://twitter.com/EnricoTobio2/status/1001540899527110658):

I noticed [a difference between seashore paspalum and manilagrass lawns](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-05-21-paspalum-and-manilagrass-lawns/).

Maria Tomaso-Peterson showed how she [inoculates MiniVerde with a root pathogen](https://twitter.com/maria_turfdr/status/997509348648738817) for an exciting research project happening this summer:

I listed some turfgrass stories that are [organized as Twitter Moments](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-05-22-turf-stories-as-twitter-moments/).

I wrote about the [Smith-Kerns Dollar Spot Prediction Model](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-05-30-probability-of-dollar-spot/).

Sue Crawford is in the second year of [measuring the clipping volume](https://twitter.com/eastcoastsue1/status/998502430005489664). This
[#ClipVol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/clipvol?src=hash) thing is really taking off. 

{{< tweet "998502430005489664" >}}

Bill Kreuser and Frank Rossi [talked about clipping yield and managing turfgrass growth](http://www.turfnet.com/blog/4/entry-1588-dr-bill-kreuser-clipping-yield-and-managing-turfgrass-growth/). Highly recommended.

Is carbon ["the next frontier in fertilization?"](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-05-31-is-carbon-the-next-frontier-in-fertilization/)

Mike Besa noted that [the Philippines has been blessed with some of the most beautiful and challenging golf courses on the planet.](https://golflifeatbp.wordpress.com/2018/05/21/eastridge-golf-club-the-gem-of-the-east/)

Kolby Beaton found [Chambers Bay looking amazing](https://twitter.com/turfcare2012/status/1001161922627092480):

{{< tweet "1001161922627092480" >}}

Also from Mike Besa, he asked about grass in the Philippines, ["rather than spending time and resources trying to keep imported turf grasses healthy, why not use endemics or endemic hybrids that allow very similar playing conditions?"](https://golflifeatbp.wordpress.com/2018/05/21/tagaytays-crown-jewel/)

Kurt Hockemeyer found where snow was removed in winter, less [*Poa annua* was seen in the spring](https://twitter.com/kurtaculous/status/1001912019107409920):

A reminder about [the importance of nozzles](http://blogs.k-state.edu/turf/nozzles-more-interesting-and-important-than-you-think/) from Megan Kennelly. 

I usually write 50 to 100 new posts on the ATC blog each year. If you would like to get an e-mail containing each new post, you can [sign up here](http://www.subscribepage.com/atc_blog_email).

If you would like to subscribe to the [ATC updates mailing list](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate), that is sent about 6 times a year with just the highlights.

Did you know there is a [MLSN newsletter list](http://www.subscribepage.com/mlsn), also sent about 6 times a year?
