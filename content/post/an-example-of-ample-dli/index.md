In a recent ATC Doublecut discussing light and temperature, [I mentioned](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxSjzahR_onGgkvL61Ci66LqWg17R3B36m?si=f3ZIBBBmnbEKTCd5) that I'd calculate potential DLI for the recording location, check the actual DLI for the recording location, and share that information.

I've looked that up, made a chart, and wanted to explain this again real quick with one more example.

My assessment, after checking data for a lot of places, is that temperature generally plays a controlling role in how much the grass can grow. Light from the sun[^1] rarely provides a continuous limit on growth, *especially* on cool-season grass growth, in the same way.

[^1]: This is not a discussion of tree or structural shade. This is about sun, clouds, location on the planet, and day of the year, and the amount of light that reaches the earth's surface.

Figure 1 shows a snow-covered landscape. Grass is not growing. But there's plenty of photosynthetically active radiation. I looked up the DLI data for a nearby JMA station with a sensor, and those data are shown in Figure 2. On March 16, the day I recorded [that episode](https://share.transistor.fm/s/a2ed1931), the DLI was 32.4 mol/m<sup>2</sup>. If it wasn't for the partly cloudy skies, the DLI would have been close to 39.6 mol/m<sup>2</sup>. Note that even this early in the season, that's *more* light than cool-season grass can use.[^2]

[^2]: The midday PPFD was often above 1,000 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, which is the conventional light saturation point for C<sub>3</sub> grasses.

Meanwhile, in all this glorious sunshine, the high temperature on March 16 at this location was 3.8 °C, and the low temperature was -7 °C, with an average temperature of -1.3 °C. That gives a C<sub>3</sub> growth potential (GP) of 0. 

Does the GP prediction improve by adding an adjustment for light on this date, and in this location? I would argue that an adjustment doesn't improve anything in this case.
