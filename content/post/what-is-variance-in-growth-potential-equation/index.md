I've been asked about the **variance** in PACE Turf's growth potential (GP) equation. The variance adjusts the shape of the curve, as the chart above shows. With a lower variance, the GP drops quickly as **t** moves away from **t<sub>o</sub>**. With a higher variance, the GP stays higher with temperatures moving away from **t<sub>o</sub>**.
