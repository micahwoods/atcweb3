Two shows make their debut today. One is **The ATC Doublecut with Micah Woods**, in which I discuss topics from the blog. Giving those topics a doublecut, so to speak, by first writing about them and then discussing some of the background and related information for that topic.

Another show is **ATC Office Hours**. This show is going to be less frequent, is probably going to have guests (and/or be open to questions) most of the time, and is meant to be a little bit technical. Like a real office hour, but with an irregular and flexible schedule :wink:. Chris Tritabaugh and I kicked it off last week with an in-depth conversation about surface organic material and playing surface performance.

If you'd like to hear more about some of the topics I write about here, and if you'd like to listen to ATC Office Hours as they are released, then please subscribe.

Both of these shows are on the [ATC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AsianTurfgrassCenter/playlists). I realized that the content can work as audio-only material too, so I created these podcasts. I hope you'll enjoy them as a supplement to the blog.
