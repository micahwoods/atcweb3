On a recent trip to southern Europe, I was walking on a fairway and looking down at the grass. I'd seen some bermudagrass (*Cynodon*) fairways and did not notice any dollar spot. Then on this course with bentgrass, *Poa annua*, and kikuyugrass in the fairways, I saw a lot of dollar spot.

When I see an outbreak of dollar spot like this, I make a note to check the [Smith-Kerns probability model]({{< relref "/post/probability-of-dollar-spot" >}}) to see what the numbers are. I'm just checking this out of curiosity, but if I were a turfgrass manager, I'd be checking forecasts and historical data with an eye to minimizing the intensity of any disease outbreaks.

When I looked up the data for this location, it matches what I'd expect. I took that photo on June 5. And on the chart, this location had been above a 20% epidemic probability for about a week, and was just past the peak probability reached so far in the year. 

One of the many charts in the [PACE Turf](https://paceturf.org/) weather and climate appraisal section (available to PACE Turf information service subscribers) is the past five years of Smith-Kerns probability for one's location.

In the past five years, The number of days above 20% probability of an epidemic, which is a general level of expected higher risk for dollar spot, ranged from 124 days in 2019 to 179 days in 2020. I think it's especially interesting to see how the probability never got consistently above 20% in 2019 until the end of June, while in 2020 and 2021 there were weeks---months even---with probability above 20% prior to the start of June.

Knowing what's happening, what's forecasted, and what's normal for a location can be a powerful tool for disease management decision-making, and I really like how the PACE Turf charts provide the information in this format.
