I went for a walk in Kumamoto yesterday morning to take a few photos of the grass on the Kumamoto City Tram. [This page](https://www.city.kumamoto.jp/hpKiji/pub/detail.aspx?c_id=5&id=1957&class_set_id=2&class_id=3078) shows how the grass sections are installed.

Here are a few photos. The grass was looking the best I have ever seen it. I expect that's because of frequent rains over the past few months.

After I shared [a few of these photos on Twitter](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/1169756438635237376), I was asked how the grass was mowed. And a couple people sent videos that showed the impressive mowing machine used in Kagoshima.

I don't know if this same type of machine is used to care for the grass on the Kumamoto City Tram system.

[This blog post](https://shiba-teire.com/archives/2801) suggests the mower in Kagoshima cost about 40,000,000 JPY (~ USD 375,000). 

I enjoy driving or walking or riding in the city and seeing all the grass in the streets.
