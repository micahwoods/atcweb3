I taught five seminars at the Northern Green Expo in 2016.

1. The (New) Fundamentals of Turfgrass Nutrition

2. Nutrient Use by the Grass and Nutrient Supply by the Soil

3. Calculating the Fertilizer Requirement for any Turfgrass, Anywhere

4. Soil Water Management: Amount, Timing, and Syringing

5. Instead of Shade, Let's Talk About Light

I combined the handouts for each presentation into [this single document](http://www.seminar.asianturfgrass.com/2016_nge_handouts.pdf) for easy reading. I especially like this part:
