Or at least they had a captivating discussion on [The Talking Greenkeeper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-talking-greenkeeper/id1435947281?mt=2#episodeGuid=9a57de3fbe4448fb94e71d0572fc7783) show.

They talked about a lot of things:

* name dropping
* manga
* taking shoes off, or not
* doing things or applying products for a reason
* what it was like to work for Micah Woods
* what it's like to now be assistant GM in addition to head greenkeeper
* baseball
* greenkeeping in Japan
* much more

I hope you enjoy this episode of [The Talking Greenkeeper](http://thetalkinggreenkeeper.libsyn.com/website/episode-18-andrew-mcdaniel) as much as I did.

Andrew has been featured in a [manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga) series, and there was some discussion of that. I've never been in a manga, but Joe was wondering about that type of image; there are apps that can make a manga. This one says something like, translated, "My life is a double bogey."
