This chart ({{% staticref "files/tokyo_par_2015.png" %}}download at full size{{% /staticref %}}) shows the average photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) for each hour of 2015 at Tokyo. The daily light integral (DLI) is the number written in black at the top right corner of each facet in this chart.

One can get some idea of how the DLI changes seasonally and with cloudy weather; one can also see how the PPFD changes from sunny to cloudy days at different times of the year.
