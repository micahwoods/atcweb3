Regular readers of this blog will have seen various posts about grass growth rate and the routine measurement of clipping volume. I've taken many of those posts, some new material, and a couple reports, and put them together into a book. I called it [*One Bucket at a Time*](https://micahwoods.github.io/buckets/).

The book is available as html for reading on any device, and as epub and pdf for download. I'm working on some improvements to this and will then get it in print.
