The day has finally arrived! 

I had a great time making this movie. I've been fortunate to have many friends around the world who have taught me a lot, and I spoke with some of them in this video. I've also learned a lot by observing, traveling to observe some more, and thinking. 

I hope you'll enjoy watching this second episode of my *Grammar of Greenkeeping* show: [Still Learning](https://youtu.be/v7vGx9GQV2w).
