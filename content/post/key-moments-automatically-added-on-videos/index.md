Some videos on the [ATC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/asianturfgrasscenter) have chapters---timestamps---that I have added for different topics. I haven't done that for all the videos, but it is really cool that YouTube has identified some of the topics and added the timestamps automatically.

Many of the videos on the channel have "key moments" that have been identified by YouTube. The key moments are visible on the desktop version of YouTube by clicking "show more" to see the full video description, and then the key moments appear.[^1]

[^1]: I didn't see key moments when I watch videos and click to see the full video description using the YouTube mobile app. If anyone knows if this is possible and how to see the key moments on mobile, please let me know.
