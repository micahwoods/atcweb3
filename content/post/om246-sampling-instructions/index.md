I've written a lot about [OM246]({{< relref "/project/om246" >}}) testing for total organic material by depth in the soil, and why I think this test is so useful. Something I hadn't written, until this week, is my own set of sampling instructions. Now I have, and you can download the [2 page instructions here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/project/om246/om246_sampling_instructions.pdf).
