I was in Hua Hin for two days of shooting with Mattias Brännholm of [Brama](https://brama.se/). We were discussing [MLSN]({{< relref "/mlsn" >}}), which I described as a modern way to make fertilizer recommendations for turfgrass.

We did most of the shooting at Banyan Golf Club. I tried to explain MLSN as best as I could. When anyone is taking care of grass, it's necessary to ask, and then get a good answer to, the questions "Is a particular nutrient element required as fertilizer?" and "If the element is required, how much should I apply?"

The MLSN method gives the right answer to those questions, pretty much every time, if your objective is to prevent nutrient deficiencies while at the same time avoiding unnecessary application of fertilizer.

I'll be sure to let you know when the film is released.
