From September 2000 to August 2001, I was the greenkeeper at Habu CC in Chiba prefecture, near Tokyo. When I look at photos of the course from that month, I recall the hard work of golf course maintenance that summer. I remember that it was hot, and that we had to irrigate a lot, and that I or one of the interns or employees would have to go to the course every night to check if the irrigation system was working properly. 

I wondered just how hot and dry it was that month. So I looked it up. The nearby Chiba station has data from 1966. I have made a few plots to show these data (through 2012).

July 2001 matched the previous record monthly average temperature, and that record was only broken in 2010. This chart includes a red line with the average for all 47 years, and the data for 2001 are shown in a green square. The mean July temperature in 2001 was more than 2.5°C above the long-term average.

At the time, July 2001 set a new record for average daily high temperature, breaking the previous record by almost 1°C, nearly 4°C above the long-term average. That record was broken in July 2004.

Combined with the record-setting heat, I was surprised to discover that it was the driest July on record, with only 8 mm of precipitation, less than 10% of the long-term average.

I remember that we worked hard that summer, but at the time, I did not realize that we were working through record heat and drought. Thanks to the detailed records of the [Japan Meteorological Agency](https://www.jma.go.jp/), I now have a better idea of how that month compares to a typical July. 

And with that knowledge, I am especially grateful to the fine greenkeeping staff from that summer---a third of whom have gone on to become golf course superintendents themselves---who worked so hard to maintain these conditions through that record-setting heat and drought.
