These are [my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/managing-turfgrass-diseases-in-asia-with-minimal-input-1) for today's presentation in the "Precision Turf and Ornamental Disease Management in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century" session at the International Congress of Plant Pathology in Boston.

The [abstract for my presentation is here](https://www.apsnet.org/meetings/annual/meetingarchives/Pages/2018Abstracts.aspx?LID=118). I'm not a plant pathologist, but what I've been invited to speak about---and what I work on---is very much related to the theme of this year's Congress: *plant health in a global economy*.
