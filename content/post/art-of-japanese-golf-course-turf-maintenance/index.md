There's a short video about greenkeeper Mamoru Shoji and [course maintenance at Kasumigaseki CC](https://youtu.be/MDH8SoNdDsk) on YouTube. I especially like the view from the drone just after the 3 minute mark, showing the greens nestled among the carefully trimmed pine trees. That's a classic look of golf in Japan.
