The Thailand GCSA's Sustainable Turfgrass Management in Asia conference returned this week. Delegates from all over the world gathered in Pattaya to learn about the latest in turfgrass management---the tools, techniques, and technologies that can be used today. I gave three presentations at this conference (plus taught at a water droplet penetration test station during the field day).

I spoke about minimizing disease and reducing fungicide use, about producing high quality surfaces with less water, and about the characteristics of tropical turfgrasses. You can see all my slides, and those of the other speakers, at [the seminar handout page](/seminar/stmia-2024/).

Since the start of 2024, I gave [two seminars in Hong Kong](/seminar/sctma-2024/), two more in Tokyo, prepared a brand new [OM246 video](https://youtu.be/Tc8dcBBt1zc) for the Ontario Turfgrass Symposium, delivered [two seminars in Montreal](/seminar/cgsa-2024/) at the Canadian Golf Course Management Conference, and then Pattaya. That's five conferences or meetings finished. 

And I've got a big one coming up. On April 3, I'm going to discuss *Systematic Improvement of Course Conditions* at Horry Georgetown Technical College for the Palmetto GCSA Education Meeting. Dr. Jordan Booth from the USGA Green Section will be speaking too, and in the afternoon we are going to have a field day at the Horry Georgetown Turf Care Center. If you'd like to attend, please register (and see the detailed schedule) at [www.carolinasgcsa.org](https://www.carolinasgcsa.org/).

I worked with Horry Georgetown students in 1997 and hired one as an intern in 2000. I've worked and talked with many of the professors from that school over the years. But this will be my first time to visit the campus. I'm really looking forward to this, and I hope everyone in the area can come join this meeting.
