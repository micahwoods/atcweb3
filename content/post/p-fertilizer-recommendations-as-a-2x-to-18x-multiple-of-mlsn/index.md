After I wrote [this post]({{< relref "/post/fertilizer-recommendations-by-spf-slan-mlsn" >}}) about the differences in P fertilizer recommendations when using different methods for soil test interpretation, I heard from some readers that it seemed I was taking something simple---MLSN---and making it seem complicated.

That was exactly opposite of what I was trying to do!

In this post, I'll jump to the conclusions, to the bottom line, in the chart shown above. 

I was working with 50,000 simulated sites. Each had its own soil test value and N rate. If SLAN or SPF recommendations were used, those methods would recommend from 2 to 18 times more P than would the MLSN method.

I discussed this on the [ATC Doublecut](https://share.transistor.fm/s/33202339).
