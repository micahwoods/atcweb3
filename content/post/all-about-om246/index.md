The key thing about OM246 testing for total organic material is that the sample is handled and measured to explicitly *include* all the living and dead undecomposed plant material in the sample. Roots, thatch, humus, mat, rhizomes, stems---that's all part of the measurement. Soil organic matter testing, on the other hand, explicitly *excludes* the undecomposed living and dead plant material. Thatch, mat, roots, stems---that's all removed from the sample before checking a 2 gram scoop of soil for the humus that remains after the big chunks of organic material are gone.

That distinction between the two tests was something I tried to make clear through words, photos, and a video in a seminar about total organic material testing. I've recorded a screencast of the seminar [here](https://youtu.be/MZBk-efrcjM).

You can see a highlight reel of the seminar [here, on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtfkfLvoTUj/?igshid=Y2IzZGU1MTFhOQ%3D%3D). We also went to the 9<sup>th</sup> green at HIBARI Golf to demonstrate OM246 sample collection.

You can see the [seminar handout](/seminar/2023-06-takarazuka/) for more information and to download the slides.
