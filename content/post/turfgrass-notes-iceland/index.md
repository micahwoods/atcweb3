I was in Iceland to speak with the Icelandic Green- and Groundskeepers Association about turfgrass nutrient requirements. Read more about the seminar, and download the presentation slides and handout, in [this report]({{< relref "/post/method-for-estimating-turfgrass-nutrient-requirements-iceland-report" >}}) about a method for estimating turfgrass nutrient requirements.

This is a quick summary report of interesting things I noted on this trip; see the [photo gallery with turf images here]({{< relref "/post/turfgrass-in-iceland" >}}).

* The association were most hospitable, allowing me to visit 11 golf courses on this trip, along with other botanical expeditions to geysers, waterfalls, ocean cliffs, volcanic craters, and lawns.

* There are 70 golf courses in Iceland. The population is 320,000. Many people are surprised that there are so many courses.&#0160;

* The courses here are at 63 to 66° N. The temperature, however, is moderated by the [Gulf Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream). It is relatively cool, but not exceedingly cold, and fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*) thrives here.

* For a look at how temperatures in Reykjavik may influence turf growth and nitrogen requirement, see the [growth potential document](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/201306_growth_potential.pdf) which includes figures and charts about growth potential of Reykjavik in comparison to other world cities. In summary, Reykjavik has a short growing season.
  
* In mown, irrigated, and fertilized turf, *Poa annua* can grow well also. Turfgrass managers in Iceland are trying to encourage the growth of *Festuca* and discourage the growth of *Poa*.

* Because most of the courses are near the ocean, salt spray can be a problem in discoloring and reducing the growth rate of the grass. Geysir GC, 63 km from the sea, is the most inland course in the country.

* Keilir GC golf course manager and Green- and Groundskeeper Association board member Bjarni Þór Hannesson is a member of the critically acclaimed band [**worm is green**](http://www.wormisgreen.com/). They've toured in China, Eastern Europe, and the United States, and I recommend going to a show if they are ever in your area. Or buy some albums.

* Iceland and its grasses and golf courses are fascinating. Do visit if you ever have a chance. It is a convenient stop when traveling between the United States and Europe.
