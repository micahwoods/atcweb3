In 2013, I volunteered at Keya Golf Club during the KBC Augusta Golf Tournament. I collected data on putting green performance, and I mowed fairways.

With all the korai greens (this is _Zoysia matrella_, common English name is manilagrass) in Japan and in other parts of Asia, this is the only tournament on the Japanese men's tour played on korai greens each year. I wanted to see how the ball rolled on korai greens prepared for a professional tournament.

In [this video](https://youtu.be/YajsiwdGkcI), I introduce the world's most famous course with korai greens---Kawana Hotel's Fuji Course, ranked in the world's top 100. And I show how the ball rolls on korai greens by demonstrating the  Holing Out Test with a Greenstester. Actually, I was behind the camera, and course superintendent [Andrew McDaniel](https://twitter.com/drumcturf) was using the Greenstester.
