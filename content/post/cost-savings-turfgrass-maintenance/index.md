There is a great article in the USGA _Green Section Record_ about cost savings and turfgrass maintenance. Sometimes golf courses must find ways to reduce expenses on turfgrass maintenance, and the article [Dollars and Sense: Making It in a Tough Economy](https://gsr.lib.msu.edu/2000s/2009/090531.pdf) provides a number of tips to save money.

I encourage anyone interested in getting the most efficient use of their turf maintenance expenditures to read it. Some of the advice includes:

* the use of growth regulators to reduce mowing
* use less expensive fertilizer 
* eliminate all nutrients except nitrogen for a season (I'd recommend soil nutrient analysis too)
* more frequent rolling of the greens

The article includes scores of ways in which you may be able to save money. I counted 84 bullet pointed ideas in the article, under categories such as Greens, Tees, Fairways, Trees, Equipment, Labor, and so on.
