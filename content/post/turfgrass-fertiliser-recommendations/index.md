In the autumn of 2017, Stewart Brown wrote to me. 

> "Dear Sir,

> I write on behalf of the European Turfgrass Society for which I am the current President."

He was inviting me to give a keynote presentation at the 2018 conference in Manchester. Sure, that sounded great, but what would they like me to talk about? I mentioned that I could discuss *Turf Around the World,* or talk about some of my research projects more specifically. When Stewart wrote back, he requested something more general, but clearly tied in with the [MLSN project](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2016_mlsn_paper/).

> "We would like you to present on fertiliser guidelines---I believe you have expertise in minimum inputs?"

That's how I came to be speaking to a diverse audience of turfgrass scientists and industry professionals in Manchester last Monday. The slides can be [downloaded here](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/turfgrass-fertiliser-recommendations-with-or-without-soil-tests). I've just recorded a screencast of the slides with my commentary, and you [can watch that here](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/ets18) or embedded below.

I described the problem of making turfgrass fertiliser recommendations from soil tests, and I gave two solutions. One is the [Precision Fertilisation](http://www.sterf.org/sv/library/handbooks/fertilisation) approach from STERF. A second is the [MLSN]({{< relref "/mlsn" >}}) approach.
