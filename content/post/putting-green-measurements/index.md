Many podcasts go on for hours. Mine often do. But this one is only 20 minutes, and for information density---a lot of useful insight in a short time---this particular episode is hard to beat.

Adam Moeller from the USGA Green Section spoke with Chris Tritabaugh at Hazeltine National GC about the measurements he makes on putting greens. How he collects the data, what insights he obtains, and a few examples of things he's been surprised by, or adjusted, in response to these measurements.
