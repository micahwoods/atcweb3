I made two new videos that you may like to watch.

[This one](https://youtu.be/Mf5urrw77LU) shows a circle mowing technique on bentgrass greens that accomplishes a ton of things all at once.

These include:

* the blades are cutting for the entire time because there are no turns off the green
* this causes a double cut, or more, in different directions, which may be useful in cutting extra leaves and reducing grain
* because there are no turns off the green, there is no traffic or turns on collars and green surrounds---these surfaces may benefit when given a respite from traffic

I also made a video showing [all the grasses I found](https://youtu.be/KOo6yEgi5ig) on a walk at Ishigaki Island.

I walked along the same section of beach that I explored in 2012. I found, and discussed, a lot of warm-season grass species. I like to study how grasses perform in the wild, and in what type of environment they are found. As I explained in [the video](https://youtu.be/KOo6yEgi5ig), there's plenty to be learned about grass selection and maintenance simply by observing how these grasses perform in nature.

In addition to those videos, I also recorded an [ATC Doublecut podcast](https://doublecut.asianturfgrass.com/) with Dr. John Rowland from the USGA Green Section. We talked about soil testing, seasonal changes in test results, organic matter testing, some sampling and lab protocol issues, and a range of things that are useful to understand about soil tests.

That ATC Doublecut episode is available for [listening as a podcast](https://share.transistor.fm/s/3edc1a79) or you can [watch the episode](https://youtu.be/BVsUKM4e0pI) on YouTube.
