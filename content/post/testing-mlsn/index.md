I listened to Joe Gulotti's Talking Greenkeeper podcast with guest Daniel Palin about an MLSN trial on 9 holes, and a different method on the other 9 holes. 

You can [listen to the show](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/daniel-palin/id1435947281?i=1000647459615) for the full story.

In short, MLSN produced the same results as the other method, golfers have been effusive in their praise of course conditions, there's now been a switch to the MLSN approach on all 18 holes, I understand, and there has been a substantial amount of money re-allocated from unnecessary fertilizer cost, now being spent on improving soil physical properties.
