On a recent trip to Japan, I'd wanted to get a new video of a core sweeper in operation. Unfortunately for me, but fortunately for the greenkeeper, who had a laugh about this, the sweepers clean the greens so fast that by the time I arrived there were no more cores to sweep. The machine was parked in the maintenance yard.

I made a [short video](https://youtu.be/yv26e9rqwBw) with a few old clips I have of these machines.

Core sweepers are a standard piece of maintenance equipment at golf courses in Japan. For more information about the Hatsuta and Baroness sweepers shown in this video, see https://www.hatsuta-ksk.co.jp/english/product/sweeper.html and http://www.baroness.co.jp/world/fs900.html
