Someone asked me that question while we were working at a golf tournament. The *best* way depends on just how much info you want, or how often you want to hear from me/ATC. Here's a list, ordered by decreasing frequency of updates (approximate).

1. The [@asianturfgrass](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass) account on Twitter will have links to all my new blog posts, reshares of some old topical ones, and some retweets and other turf discussion.

2. The [Asian Turfgrass Center website](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/) has hundreds of posts about turfgrass info and ideas of all types. New information goes up, on average, about 75 times a year.

3. Since July 2022, I've been the director of the [PACE Turf information service](https://www.paceturf.org/). There are some free resources there, and a wealth of additional material is available to [subscribers](https://www.paceturf.org/members/signup).

4. Sign up for one or more of the [ATC email newsletters](https://subscribepage.com/atc_newsletters). You can automatically get an email with the full text of each new blog the same day it is posted. You can choose to get an email every few months with highlights. You can get a newsletter *only* about MLSN. There's even a secret one about soil testing.

5. The [About section](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/#about) on the website has links for all of ATC's social media accounts.

6. There are turfgrass videos on the [ATC YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/asianturfgrasscenter).

7. You can listen to podcasts: [The ATC Doublecut with Micah Woods](https://atc-doublecut.transistor.fm/) and [ATC Office Hours](https://atc-office-hours.transistor.fm/). 

8. Books. I've got [four books available now](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/#books) and am always working on getting more.

9. Have you ever checked out [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JAlxOXEAAAAJ&hl=en)? That link has a lot of technical articles I've written or co-authored. And there are even more---209 to be exact, as of today---at the [Turfgrass Information File](http://tic.lib.msu.edu/tgif/flink?name=Woods,%20Micah).
