Someone asked me that when we were working at a golf tournament. The best way depends on just how much info you want, or how often you want to hear from me/ATC. 

Here are 9 sources of info, ranked in approximate order from most frequent info stream to least frequent.

1. The [@asianturfgrass](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass) account on Twitter will have links to all my new blog posts, reshares of some old topical ones, and some retweets and other turf discussion.

2. The [Asian Turfgrass Center website](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/) has hundreds of posts about turfgrass info and ideas of all types. New information goes up, on average, about 75 times a year.

3. You can automatically get an email with the text of each new website update with the [ATC blog by email](http://www.subscribepage.com/atc_blog_email) newsletter.

4. The [About section](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/#about) on the website has links for all of ATC's social media accounts.

5. The [ATC updates newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate) is sent out by email a few times a year, with a summary of the most interesting things I've been working on, or that I've read, seen, or written.

6. There is also a [MLSN newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/mlsn) that I keep focused on one topic --- the MLSN soil nutrient guidelines.

7. There is an [ATC updates newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate_jp) in Japanese too. I include the original English text at the bottom of this newsletter, so if you just can't get enough info, and would like to know what I'm sending to people in Japan, you can sign up to that too!

8. Books. I've got [three books available now](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/project/books/) and am always working on getting more.

9. Have you ever checked out [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JAlxOXEAAAAJ&hl=en)? That link has a lot of technical articles I've written or co-authored. And there are even more---209 to be exact, as of today---at the [Turfgrass Information File](http://tic.lib.msu.edu/tgif/flink?name=Woods,%20Micah).
