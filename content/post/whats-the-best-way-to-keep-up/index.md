Someone asked me that question while we were working at a golf tournament. The *best* way depends on just how much info you want, or how often you want to hear from me/ATC. Here are ten ways, listed in decreasing order of update frequency (approximate).

1. The [@asianturfgrass](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass) account on Twitter will have links to all my new blog posts, reshares of some old topical ones, and some retweets and other turf discussion.

2. The [Asian Turfgrass Center website](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/) has hundreds of posts about turfgrass info and ideas of all types. New information goes up, on average, about 75 times a year.

3. You can automatically get an email with the text of each new website update with the [ATC blog by email](http://www.subscribepage.com/atc_blog_email) newsletter.

4. The [About section](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/#about) on the website has links for all of ATC's social media accounts.

5. There are turfgrass videos on the [ATC YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/asianturfgrasscenter).

6. You can listen to podcasts: [The ATC Doublecut with Micah Woods](https://atc-doublecut.transistor.fm/) and to [ATC Office Hours](https://atc-office-hours.transistor.fm/). 

7. The [ATC updates newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate) is sent out by email a few times a year, with a summary of the most interesting things I've been working on, or that I've read, seen, or written.

8. There is also a [MLSN newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/mlsn) that I keep focused on one topic --- the MLSN soil nutrient guidelines.

9. Books. I've got [four books available now](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/#books) and am always working on getting more.

10. Have you ever checked out [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JAlxOXEAAAAJ&hl=en)? That link has a lot of technical articles I've written or co-authored. And there are even more---209 to be exact, as of today---at the [Turfgrass Information File](http://tic.lib.msu.edu/tgif/flink?name=Woods,%20Micah).
