*GCM Magazine* has another article about the SLAN and MLSN methods for soil test interpretation. [The article](https://www.gcmonline.com/research/news/turfgrass-nutrition-slan-mlsn) summarizes Jackie Guevara's research (with Kevin Frank at Michigan State University) into turfgrass response when P and K applications are made based on MLSN. See the [soil test showdown]({{< relref "/post/soil-test-showdown" >}}) for more about that project.

In a new video, Carl Schimenti explained the use of MLSN: [The Par/Birdie/Eagle approach to Nutrient Management](https://youtu.be/HwUbixBem4I).

This is a project he's working on with Rick Slattery and Frank Rossi and the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute. When you get to the [example about K recommendation](https://youtu.be/HwUbixBem4I?t=705), you might be shocked at the difference in fertilizer amounts recommended between conventional guidelines and MLSN.

I love seeing people doing research about, and making use of, (and writing articles and making videos about) the [MLSN]({{< relref "/mlsn" >}}) method for soil test interpretation.
