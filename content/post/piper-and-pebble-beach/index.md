Last week I was in California for the U.S. Amateur Championship at Pebble Beach. 

{{< figure src="pebble6.jpg" >}}

I was running on a trail in the [Del Monte Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Monte_Forest,_California) on Saturday when I came to an open area called *The Meadow*.

Beside the trail there you can see this marker, noting that the trail is dedicated to Vern Yadon.

As I was reading the plaque, I saw that Yadon has a species of *Piperia* named after him---[*Piperia yadonii*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperia_yadonii). The genus *Piperia* is named for Charles Vancouver Piper, the first chairman of the USGA Green Section.

I've written about Piper before. [This profile](http://gsr.lib.msu.edu/2000s/2006/060317.pdf) highlights some of the interesting things I learned as I studied Piper's life and work. He climbed Mt. Rainier with John Muir; he was a founding member of the American Society of Agronomy; he traveled to the Philippines and to Panama on army business to find suitable forages; and he had a genus of orchid, *Piperia*, named for him.

[Rolla Kent Beattie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolla_Kent_Beattie) wrote this about Piper:

> "Those who knew him in his later years only remember him chiefly for his brilliant leadership in the agronomic field. But Professor Piper's older friends think of him as a naturalist, especially as a botanical explorer and pioneer. Aptly was he named Vancouver. What George Vancouver did for the geography of Puget Sound and the Pacific Northwest and more, Piper did for the botany."

I thought it fitting that in this mecca of American golf, in the forests above Pebble Beach and Cypress Point and Spyglass Hill, there are orchids named for Piper.
