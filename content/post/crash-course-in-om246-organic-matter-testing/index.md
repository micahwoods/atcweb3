I put together a couple videos that discuss total organic material testing. 

First, [this one](https://youtu.be/UQz46PvKHtI), which shows some samples I've collected. From my office, to the post office, I discuss what is going to happen with them at the laboratory.

Second, I put together [this one that steps through the samples](https://youtu.be/0ltDhj3PzG8) collected in October 2021 on the ninth green at Hazeltine National Golf Club. This looks at the green itself, moves on to drying the samples, to what the samples look like after the burn in the muffle furnace. Let's just say the organic matter is turned to ash.

More information about the sampling and the mass loss on ignition are explained in:

* the [OM246 project page](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/project/om246/)
* my post about [temperature for loss on ignition in turfgrass soils]({{< relref "/post/measuring-organic-matter-ignition-temperature" >}})
* my presentation slides about [Thinking Differently](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/thinking-differently-trying-to-reduce-topdressing-and-core-aerification-by-careful-adjustment-of-the-growth-rate-and-organic-matter): trying to reduce topdressing and core aerification by careful adjustment of the growth rate and organic matter
