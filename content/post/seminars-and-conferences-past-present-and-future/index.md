If you've participated in any of my recent seminars, you may have seen that I've included a QR code that takes you to a page where the slides can be downloaded, and where I add some supplemental information or answer questions that came up during the seminar. These pages are listed on the Seminar handouts page.

In 2023 I taught seminars in Canada, Japan, Finland, France, and the USA.

In the next few months, come see me talk about a wide range of topics at these events:

* January 19, South China Turf Managers Association meeting at Clearwater Bay Golf and Country Club
* February 27--29, [The Canadian Golf Course Management Conference](https://golfsupers.com/TheCanadian.html) in Montreal
* March 4--6, [Sustainable Turfgrass Management in Asia](https://stmia.asianturfgrass.com/) in Pattaya, Thailand. The Thai GCSA are bringing their popular conference back after a three year hiatus.

I'll also be giving a couple invitation-only seminars in Tokyo in February.
