Zoysia putting greens are common from Japan to Singapore because manilagrass---*Zoysia matrella*, or *korai* in Japanese---is tolerant of close mowing in the climate of East and Southeast Asia.  The ball roll on zoysia putting greens is distinctive because the grass leaves are so stiff.

I made [this new video](https://youtu.be/0yiM7Ti08do) with an explanation, some choice quotes from Herbert Warren Wind, and a couple demonstrative rolls.

I've shown in another video how good the roll can be on zoysia greens. It takes a lot of work to get that type of roll, however, which is certainly a big reason why GOLF Magazine's ranking of the world's top 100 golf courses includes only one with zoysia greens.
