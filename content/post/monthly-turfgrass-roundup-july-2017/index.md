In this month's roundup, topdressing sand, three posts about saving a ton of money and getting better results, P deficiency, green speed, and much more.

TurfNet's *Living Legends* series with [this article](http://www.turfnet.com/blog/33/entry-1452-tom-cook-pioneered-the-turf-program-at-oregon-state-university/) about Tom Cook.

For routine clipping measurement, [clipping volume or clipping weight?](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-04-volume-or-weight/)

This is an [exceptional economic case study](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-05-saving-82-percent-gsr/) about reducing a cost by 82%.

Allan Dewald found a couple cool tricks to get [better surfaces with less effort](https://twitter.com/allan_dewald/status/890323223186857984):

I came across this article, about the [world running out of sand](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/29/the-world-is-running-out-of-sand).

You might rethink what you throw into the spray tank. In 11 attempts, Si failed to increase green speed [*every single time*](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-06-rethink-throw-spray-tank-si/).

[This short update](http://turf.unl.edu/late-summer-yellowing-kentucky-bluegrass-and-creeping-bentgrass-0) about late summer iron chlorosis from Bill Kreuser.

Brad Revill asked, "is it possible to [reduce fertiliser expenses by 69%?](https://www.bradrevillturf.com/goingagainstthegrain/23/5/2017/mlsn-nikanti-gc-reducing-expenses-and-inputs-since-2016)" 

Jonathan Wood shared more [spectacular photos](https://twitter.com/jonwood1978/status/891307869018181632) of the Castle Course:

Chris Tritabaugh wrote [about **Poa!**](https://www.hazeltinenational.com/turf-blog/poa) on the Hazeltine Turf Blog. In summary, "the careful exploitation of these differences between bentgrass and *Poa* are what leads to limited *Poa* in a bentgrass surface."

Jason Haines asked how to get [more followers as a superintendent](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-12-more-followers-as-supt-suggestion/). 

And he wonders if he can manipulate clipping yield to [reduce disease this September](http://www.turfhacker.com/2017/07/can-i-use-clipping-yield-to-prevent.html).

As a [way to increase green speed, this makes no sense at all](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-14-si-does-this-make-sense-to-you/).

Different species will have different resistance to ball roll. [This is what I expect the differences to be](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-16-species-ease-speed/).

And [here's what the differences are, for green speed of different species](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-17-green-speed-joyplot/).

Eric Reasor asked about [visual identification](https://twitter.com/TurfBlade/status/891639881503518722) of ultradwarf bermudagrasses:

I spoke about turfgrass at a tourism convention. [Here are 5 ways to get the best playing conditions with the fewest inputs](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-21-thailand-golf-paradise-seminar/).

[How low can you go with P on bentgrass?](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-26-phosphorus-deficiency-photo/)

[Preview of my presentations](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-27-coming-up-in-october/) and a chart with all kinds of clipping volume information, in advance of the Northwest GCSA Turfgrass Expo.

After reducing expenses by $150,000, what happened? [Checking in 8 months later](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-27-remember-this-checking-in-after-implementing-gp-mlsn/), and you might be shocked at the results.
