I've made some updates to the standard OM246 report this year. The portion of the report with charts is showing four distinct things, and I showed examples and explained them in [this video](https://youtu.be/wUtpJC1YPU0).

{{< youtube "wUtpJC1YPU0" >}}

The charts on the report show these things:

* [OM by depth over time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUtpJC1YPU0&t=75s), the total organic matter by depth, and how it has changed over time

* [OM by depth by species](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUtpJC1YPU0&t=726s), the most recent test results, and how those results compare to OM246 results for surfaces of the same grass species

* A [scatterplot by depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUtpJC1YPU0&t=1173s), showing each sample from the most recent tests, with background information about other samples from all grass species at those same depths

* The entire [surface layer OM by time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUtpJC1YPU0&t=1406s), which combines the OM2, OM4, and OM6 data, with adjustments for soil bulk density, to show how the surface layer is changing as a whole

After trying many different ways to look at OM246 results, the ones that I now find most useful are the four that I show on the report. I describe these in detail in the video. So if you'd like to hear more about what these charts are showing, and my comments about what I find especially relevant, please have a watch and listen.

Also, when you know the sand topdressing amount, and have OM246 data, you can start to make precise sand topdressing calculations based on the calculated [organic matter accumulation rate]({{< relref "/post/three-things-to-do-with-om246-data-right-now" >}}).
