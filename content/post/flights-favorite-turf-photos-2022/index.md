I got to see a lot of beautiful and interesting turfgrass around the world in 2022. I looked through my photos from the year and chose these as my favorites. 

Before getting to the turf photos, though, I like to check where I went by air. There was so little air travel in 2020 and 2021 that I did not bother making a map for those years. It was a relatively busy year for travel in 2022---[my 2019 flight map](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/flights-turf-photos/) was 56 flights for 161,473 km, by comparison.

Now for the photos.

{{< figure src="sunrise.jpg" caption="This is actually a capture from a video I took of cup cutting at Camiral during the Catalunya Championship. The bentgrass greens were superb; I wrote a blog post about [the conditions that week](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/our-vip-tent-seminar-at-catalunya-championship/)." >}}

{{< figure src="stenotaphrum.jpg" caption="I was surprised to find *Stenotaphrum secundatum* growing wild at the northern edge of the West Cliffs property in Portugal. I had also seen this grass on a hotel lawn in Porto, and in the Algarve, and in central Tokyo, and of course in Florida, earlier in the year." >}}

{{< figure src="419.jpg" caption="I made my first trip to Tifton, Georgia. There's a grass garden there---or should it be called a grass museum?---with *the* official grass material for famous varieties used all over the world." >}}

{{< figure src="boat.jpg" caption="I got a tip about a grass shipment happening one day in the Strait of Malacca. I chartered my own boat and went to take some photos. I ended up making [this video](https://youtu.be/5rWaSy8eRQ0) about that day." >}}

{{< figure src="crucibles.jpg" caption="These are crucibles at Brookside Labs in New Bremen, Ohio, USA, used for the measurement of soil organic matter. I made a visit to the lab in March and learned more about the details of the testing procedures and sample processing." >}}

{{< figure src="driveway.jpg" caption="In my runs around home in southern Thailand, I see plenty of *Zoysia* growing wild. This driveway provides a particularly good example of the dramatic effect of rolling on *Zoysia* appearance." >}}

{{< figure src="gibraltar.jpg" caption="I saw the Rock of Gibraltar for the first time this year. I also saw some well-maintained *Cynodon*." >}}

{{< figure src="island.jpg" caption="Another excursion into the Strait of Malacca brought me to a small island in the Andaman Sea with some monostands of fine-bladed *Zoysia* growing right up to the beach." >}}

{{< figure src="pines.jpg"  caption="*Zoysia matrella* lawns in central Tokyo and pine trees glittering in the summer sun." >}}

{{< figure src="ski.jpg" caption="Near Copenhagen in July, I took a field trip at the International Turfgrass Research Conference that brought me to a grassed ski slope that is [on top of a power plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amager_Bakke). Extraordinary!" >}}

{{< figure src="sheep.jpg" caption="We've all heard about the courses in New Zealand that are grazed by sheep. In August, I stopped by Taihape Golf Course and saw one for myself." >}}

{{< figure src="zoysia.jpg"  caption="There are two different varieties of fine-bladed *Zoysia* invading this Tifeagle green near Bangkok." >}}

{{< figure src="lawn.jpg" caption="This lawn in Bangkok was planted more than a decade ago to *Zoysia matrella*. It is now primarily tropical carpetgrass --- *Axonopus compressus*. I check this lawn when I am in Bangkok for species composition, and in 2022 I also checked for seasonal zoysia seedhead production and made some observations of leaf wetness." >}}

{{< figure src="mow.jpg"  caption="Another beautiful morning at Camiral. Also, check the overlap on this half freaky doublecut." >}}
