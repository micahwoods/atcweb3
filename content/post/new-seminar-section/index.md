There was a time when I habitually made seminar handouts as web pages.[^1] Then I stopped doing that. 

From about 2015 I was posting seminar slides on [my SpeakerDeck account](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods). But I haven't been doing that for a couple years, and I now generally make a video screencast of a presentation if I really want to share it.

I realize, however, that I often mention specific articles or videos or websites during my presentations, and it seems like that information can easily be provided on a web page for those in the audience who wish to have direct links to this type of material.

I'm going to try the web page thing again, and I have started a new [`/seminar/`]({{< relref "/seminar/" >}}) section on the ATC website to host these "handout" pages.

{{< cta cta_text="Visit the seminar handout page" cta_link="/seminar/" cta_new_tab="false" >}}

I've also tried putting the QR code to the handout in the slides for these presentations. 

[^1]: This was something I did for many of my seminars in 2013 to 2015. See for example the [nutrient use handout for GCSAA](http://www.seminar.asianturfgrass.com/20131024_gcsaa.html), the [Everything you need to know about turfgrass nutrition in 1 lecture](https://seminar.asianturfgrass.com/2014_osu.html) handout from a guest lecture at Oregon State University, and [Estimating turfgrass nutrient use](http://seminar.asianturfgrass.com/20150128_ontario.html) from the Ontario Golf Superintendents Association.
