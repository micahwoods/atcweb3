A few years ago Blake Meentemeyer and Brian Whitlark wrote about fertilizer in the *Green Section Record*. I've recommended this article before, and in [that post]({{< relref "/post/how-to-save-82-on-fertilizer-cost" >}}) I highlighted a case study from the article---a "facility in the Las Vegas area" reduced putting green fertilizer cost by a staggering 82%. How? By changing from "an expensive fertility program" to "a simpler product line." Meentemeyer and Whitlark wrote that this confirms research findings "that none of the expensive fertilizer programs were superior to that of urea and iron."

I'm surprised more turfgrass managers don't take advantage of this common knowledge, to get complete control of nutrient supply, to produce incredible surfaces, and to do so for minimal cost.
