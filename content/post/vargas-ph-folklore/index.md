I was reading the "Cultural Aspects of Disease Management" chapter in *Management of Turfgrass Diseases* by Dr. Vargas and came across this gem about soil pH:

> "Most of the literature tells you that the soil pH should be maintained at the optimum level for turfgrass growth (between 6 and 7). This is really part of folklore, and is based on research done on wheat and corn. Having a pH between 6 and 7 is important so the wheat and corn plant can have phosphorus in the soil available at heading time because it is difficult to run a fertilizer down the field when the corn is six feet high. On the other hand, you can run a fertilizer spreader over your turf every day if need be."
