Joe Gulotti, host of the acclaimed Talking Greenkeeper podcast, called me to talk about aeration. We talked about that, discussed the OM246 method for measuring the exact effect of cultivation and topdressing, and managed to discuss Thai food, Kawana, soil sample lab prep, and why Joe is sleeping in the studio. Among other things.
