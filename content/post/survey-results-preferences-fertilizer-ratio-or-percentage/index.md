I asked a question in the MLSN newsletter[^1] --- when getting a recommendation for nutrients, would it make more sense to have that recommendation expressed as a ratio or as a percentage? These are the results.

[^1]: The survey was in MLSN newsletter #19, which you can [read here](https://preview.mailerlite.com/b8w6q8b5p3). To get the next one, [sign up here](https://subscribepage.com/atc_newsletters).

About 74% of survey respondents are comfortable with ratios, 20% prefer percentages, and I will explain this some more to make sure the 7% not fully understanding this goes down. 

For more about this topic, and what prompted me to pose that question in the survey, [watch](https://youtu.be/_UweU0dJbdc) or [listen](https://share.transistor.fm/s/0b420fb7) to this ATC Doublecut episode discussing ratios.
