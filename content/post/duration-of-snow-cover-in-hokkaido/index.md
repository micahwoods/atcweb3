I had a conversation with Eric Watkins about the [WinterTurf project](https://winterturf.umn.edu/). We discussed Hokkaido in northern Japan, where there is snow cover every winter. 

From past visits, I knew that snow cover usually starts in November, sometimes as late as December, and that it lasts until March or April. But I didn't know exactly what was normal.

Now I have a better idea, after looking at the JMA daily weather records since 1961. In Sapporo the median days with snow cover was 127---that's 4.2 months.

In Asahikawa, the second largest population center of Hokkaido, the median days with snow cover was 145 days---4.75 months.

That makes for good winter sports. In fact, Benjamin Warren and I talked a bit [about the best lift-access snow](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxii3jld5EByCewbkPD_wpmvapunAAjuPk) globally. Ben says for sure that snow is in Hokkaido.
