I look forward to some photos from Doug Soldat. For many years, he's had some fascinating photos to share of snow mold on creeping bentgrass. And each year, there was more snow mold where potassium fertilizer was applied, and less snow mold where potassium wasn't applied.

### Spring of 2014

In the spring of 2014, there was [more snow mold where K was applied](https://twitter.com/djsoldat/status/451454212686090240).

### Spring of 2015

The next year, there was also [more snow mold where K was applied](https://twitter.com/djsoldat/status/579280933104152578).

### Spring of 2016

Again, [more snow mold where K was applied](https://twitter.com/djsoldat/status/712639271258222592).

On those creeping bentgrass plots in Wisconsin, adding K increases snow mold. No K had less snow mold.

At Rutgers, annual bluegrass plots deficient in K have had more anthracnose in summer and more winter injury. Eliminating the deficiency reduced those problems.

And there are hundreds of other studies about K. Some show a benefit from adding K, and some don't. Making sure the grass is supplied with enough K sounds like it could be a complicated matter. But after studying this for many years, here's  what seems to be the case, for both warm-season and cool-season grasses:

> Ensuring the grass is supplied with all the K it can use will provide all the benefits associated with K. Adding more than that usually has no effect, other than wasting time and money, but sometimes has a negative effect. 

As a turfgrass manager, all one has to do is ensure the grass is supplied with all the K it can use. This can be accomplished in 2 ways. One is by keeping the soil K above the MLSN guideline. A second is by applying N:K in a 2:1 ratio for cool-season grasses, a 1:1 ratio for seashore paspalum, and a 3:2 ratio for other warm-season grasses. I wrote about that in the final chapter of [_A Short Grammar of Greenkeeping_](https://leanpub.com/short_grammar_of_greenkeeping) and in [_The (New) Fundamentals of Turfgrass Nutrition_](http://www.seminar.asianturfgrass.com/2016_nge_handouts.pdf).

Note that I _do not_ recommend tissue testing for K (or any other element). 

If you want to read more about K specifically, and about how the benefits of K come from correcting a deficiency, I recommend:
