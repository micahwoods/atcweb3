In a recent episode of the [Pullin' Weeds](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/micah-woods/id1448223294?i=1000561410364) podcast, I answered a bevy of hard-hitting questions from host Tim Kreger: 

> What's my favorite grass? Can MLSN be applied to automobile maintenance? How many species of insects have I eaten? Is clipping volume related to mass or to depth?

We also discussed the travels that brought me to South Carolina, and I told some stories about how I ended up doing what I do.

In the introduction, James Huntoon and Allen Knight mentioned [our round of golf](https://twitter.com/Pullin_Weeds/status/1506337208319586307) at Charleston Municipal Golf Course.

On a day with challenging weather conditions, and on such a difficult golf course, I was happy to make a birdie. The hole locations were tucked into corners, the new greens were firm, and missing on the short side was almost a certain bogey.

If you enjoy listening to turfgrass podcasts, I've got two of my own where I explain, discuss, and debate the turfgrass issues of our time: [The ATC Doublecut with Micah Woods](https://atc-doublecut.transistor.fm/) and [ATC Office Hours](https://atc-office-hours.transistor.fm/).
