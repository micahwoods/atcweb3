Doug Soldat has [photos showing  more snow mold](https://twitter.com/djsoldat/status/833702016652365824) where potassium fertilizer was applied. Where potassium was not applied, there is less snow mold.

[This photo](https://twitter.com/djsoldat/status/833702016652365824), starting in the top right plot with the lowest amount of snow mold, and going clockwise, is:

  * top right, no K for six years
  * bottom right, no K for six years _but_ high K added from August to October 2016
  * bottom left, high K for six years
  * top left, high K for six years _but_ no K after August 2016.

This used to be surprising. I don't think anyone expected more K to lead to more disease. But after Doug has seen this [year after year]({{< relref "/post/every-spring-when-the-snow-melts" >}}), it's not a surprise anymore.
