Some things I show and explain about turfgrass are well-suited to video format. I've put together many videos over the years, and have started gathering them into one place at the [ATC channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/AsianTurfgrassCenter).

For a few of my recent videos, I've added Japanese and Thai titles, video descriptions, and subtitles.[^1] The way this works is really cool. 

If I've added the information in those languages, then when a phone set to Japanese language, or a phone set to Thai language, opens the video, the title and the description are automatically shown in that language, as are the subtitles.

[^1]: A big thanks to Valairat Phanrang, Orawee Anothai, and Yukio Ueno for helping me out with this project.

Videos with Japanese and/or Thai subtitles so far include:

* [Distinctive ball roll on zoysia putting greens](https://youtu.be/0yiM7Ti08do)

* [How to measure smoothness and trueness of ball roll on putting greens](https://youtu.be/Fg_aDTB-O10)

* [Bounce and roll at the KBC Augusta tournament after only 1 sand topdressing this year](https://youtu.be/bbcJhA1zqNo)

This is an ongoing project, and I expect to add more videos with foreign language subtitles in the future. If there are any ATC videos (check the [current library here](https://www.youtube.com/c/AsianTurfgrassCenter/videos)) that you'd like to translate to your language, please let me know. I'd love to see some of these in Chinese, Korean, French, Spanish, Hindi, Malay, Vietnamese---you get the idea!
