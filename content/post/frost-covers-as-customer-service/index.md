I used to think of frost covers as a way to protect the grass. After I worked as a golf course superintendent in Japan, I learned that frost covers can also be used as a customer service. 

{{< figure src="6.jpg" caption="It is common to see golfers playing on frosted turf in Japan. This green gets morning sun; a frost cover was not used on this green on this morning. " >}}

James Huntoon and I [discussed frost delays on the ATC Doublecut](https://atc-doublecut.transistor.fm/episodes/an-alternative-reference-for-frost-delays-with-jim-huntoon).

I mentioned that I may do a blog post with some photos showing how frost covers are used as a customer service, rather than as a way to protect the grass. Here it is, a bit of a photo essay.

{{< figure src="8.jpg" caption="This green remains frosted until midday so a frost cover is placed over the area where the day's hole location will be." >}}

I've also seen these tools placed at every tee. The tools are provided as a service to the golfers also, with the assumption that there will be play when the ground is frozen.
