Dr. Larry Stowell and I recorded [this video interview](https://youtu.be/1rMM-4XJ5dA) (back in 2012!) about potassium fertilizer for turfgrass. 

How much potassium is enough? How should you decide how much potassium to apply to meet the plant requirements, without wasting money by applying too much? Is potassium fertilizer necessary at all? Watch this video to find out, and check out [PACE Turf](https://www.paceturf.org/) for a wealth of valuable turfgrass information.
