The maintenance equipment used on Japan's golf courses is usually similar to what is used in other parts of the world, but sometimes the equipment is quite different---the [Yanmar helicopter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZBhvnXENI4) comes to mind.

Many courses on the island of Hokkaido in northern Japan have creeping bentgrass fairways. On a visit there in late May of 2012, I saw the self-collecting fairway aerifier in action, and was surprised at how fast the fairways can be cored, and at how clean the finish is. 

I don't think this is a Japanese machine, actually, but I also haven't seen it used anywhere else.

The cores are collected in central drums and are emptied in about a minute beside the fairway.

After that fast and clean coring of the fairways, sand topdressing was applied, and these creeping bentgrass fairways were ready for the upcoming summer season.
