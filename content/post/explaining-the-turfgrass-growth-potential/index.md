[This fact sheet](https://files.asianturfgrass.com/201306_growth_potential.pdf) provides an overview of the turfgrass growth potential (GP), explaining what it is, how it is calculated, providing examples of estimated plant nitrogen use based on GP, and much more, including suggestions on how the GP can be modified and extended.

The GP is an index of the influence temperature has on turfgrass photosynthesis and growth. A simple and important extension of GP is using it to predict turfgrass nitrogen use. Ensuring that the grass is supplied with adequate amounts of nitrogen during the time when it can photosynthesize most efficiently will ensure that a maximum amount of carbohydrates are produced, leading, one expects, to a more extensive root system and healthier turfgrass plants.
