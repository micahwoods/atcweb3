These posts had the most views in 2022. As in past years, technical topics related to turfgrass management dominate this list.[^1] Four of the top ten posts in 2022 were about soil organic matter or soil organic material; two were about fertilizer or turfgrass nutrition; and two were about irrigation or soil water content.

[^1]: And as in past years, it's the ["turf tourism"](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/tag/turf-tourism/) type of posts that got the fewest views. 

Here they are.

[1] January, [An analysis of turfgrass industry Twitter accounts in 2021](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/turf-twitter-analysis-2021/), repeating the analysis made in previous years.

[2] May, [How I recommend fertilizer nutrient ratios](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/how-i-recommend-fertilizer-ratios/), and an explanation for why I think everyone should do it this way.

[3] October, [Coring: maybe the real benefit is something else?](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/coring-maybe-real-benefit-is-something-else/) This post makes a case for coring being done to stimulate turfgrass growth.

[4] April, [What if it was never there?](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/what-if-it-was-never-there/) If there is never too much organic material in the soil, nothing needs to be done to dilute it.

[5] March, [University of Florida visit and seminar](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/seminar-and-visit-at-university-of-florida/) with some lively photos and a screencast of my presentation.

[6] May, [Soil and water management: 3 primary problems, with solutions](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/soil-water-management-3-problems-with-solutions/) looks at salinity and leaching fractions, sodicity or sodium hazard, and nutrient deficiencies.

[7] January, ["I have always heard deep and infrequent was the way to go"](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/always-heard-deep-infrequent-way-to-go/)---that's what I thought at one time too, about irrigation, but that's not how I think about it now.

[8] April, [Organic material accumulates more rapidly in putting green soils under these two conditions](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/organic-material-accumulates-faster-when-soil-om-is-lower/), specifically when the soil organic matter is low to begin with, and when putting greens are young.

[9] July, [The least enjoyable experiment ever](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/least-enjoyable-experiment-ever/) involved a *lot* of product mixing.

[10] December, [Some surprising results](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/post/some-surprising-results/) about playability and the ability to topdress less frequently and in lower quantities than I once thought possible.

If you want an easy way to see a list of all the posts on the blog, the [secret archive page](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/archive/) is a good one to bookmark." >}}
