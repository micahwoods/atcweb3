I’ve shared [the posts from 2023](/post/top-10-posts-2023/) that got the most views. Then there are these 10 that got the fewest. 

For reference, the median post in the top 10 got 725 views in 2023. The median on this list only got 76! 

Part of the reason for few views may be a lack of interest in the topic. But it may also be the time of year or time of day when I published this, or perhaps it’s a poor title or a boring thumbnail image that didn’t draw much attention. 

{{< figure src="featured.jpg" caption="A thumbnail image like this might draw more clicks? But I'd like the content in each post to stand on its own. This is a deliberate mow of fairway cut into the rough to facilitate surface drainage at a high rainfall location in western Japan." >}}

When you see this list, you might find one you missed the first time around. Or you may have more time now to have a quick read of these.

Here they are, counting down from number 10 to the post with the *fewest* views in 2023.

[10] June, [Shade effect of clouds](/post/shade-effect-of-clouds/) looks at the reduction in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on a June day with 0 hours of sunshine and also links to two web apps that can find PPFD and DLI for any location in the world.

[9] May, [Converting between soil test extraction methods](/post/converting-between-soil-test-extraction-methods/) shares another reference for how to do this for Midwestern (Ohio and Indiana) soils.

[8] December, [Seminars and conferences: past, present, and future](/post/seminars-and-conferences-past-present-and-future/) has a new conference website with video and translation! Plus a list of all seminar handouts for the year.

[7] September, [Tournament diary: KBC Augusta 2023](/post/tournament-diary-kbc-augusta-2023/) is a long one---an 8 minute read the site tells me---but the reason for this is because of all the information. If you skim through this I imagine you'll learn a few things---about clay layers in greens, or surface firmness, or green speed.

[6] March, [New seminar section on the website](/post/new-seminar-section/) announcing just that---seminar handouts in a new [seminar section](/seminar/) of the ATC website.

[5] August, [Putting green data from measurement to summary](/post/putting-green-data-from-measurement-to-summary/) shows how I summarize measurements (and how I recommend others summarize them) while also taking some account of the variability in those measurements.

[4] September, [One additional chatter or snaking event in every third ball roll](/post/one-chatter-or-snaking-event-in-every-third-ball-roll/) explains in practical terms what the difference was between morning and afternoon measurements of ball roll.

[3] October, [Le Tour de France de Micah Woods](/post/le-tour-de-france-de-micah-woods/) has a nice title, but seminar announcements never seem to get many views.

[2] November, [Can soil samples dry too much?](/post/how-long-can-soil-samples-dry/) Practically, no.

[1] October, [Botanical walks and circle cuts](/post/botanical-walks-and-circle-cuts/) about mowing creeping bentgrass greens without the reels leaving the ground, and about botanical walks, and their implications for turf species selection and management.
