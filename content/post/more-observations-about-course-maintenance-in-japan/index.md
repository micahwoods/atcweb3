I reported on [four numbers]({{< relref "/post/japan-golf-by-numbers" >}}) about golf play and course maintenance after visiting 11 golf facilities:

* the mean number of golf holes per facility was 30.3
* the mean number of maintenance staff (full and part-time, and note that this is the total number of people, not expressed as full-time equivalents) was 9.5
* the mean annual N rate for bentgrass greens was 10.8 g/m<sup>2</sup>
* the mean annual rounds was 27,963 per 18 holes

I mentioned that I would be visiting courses in more populated areas and that as I added more course visits I expected the rounds to go up and the average number of holes per facility to go down.

I've now visited 16 more golf facilities---a total of 27 facilities on this trip. After adding the data from these courses, and looking at the averages again, those numbers changed in the direction I expected.

* the mean number of golf holes per facility from this trip was 24 (down from 30)
* the mean number of maintenance staff (full and part-time) per 18 holes was 12 (up from 9.5)
* the mean annual N rate for bentgrass greens was 12.5 g, up from 10.8
* the mean annual rounds were 38,583 per 18 holes, up from 27,963 (the maximum was 67,000 and the minimum was 20,000)
