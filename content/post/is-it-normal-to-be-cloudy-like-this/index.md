On 17 July 2016, I was in the Tokyo area with Jim Brosnan. The daily light integral (DLI) in Tokyo that day was 14.2 mol/m<sup>2</sup>. Jim asked me if it was exceptionally cloudy that day. Not really, I answered. I told him that the such cloudiness was normal.

Now that July 2016 is over, I looked at the DLI for every day in July at Tokyo and also at Batesville, Arkansas. Both are at about 35.7Â°N latitude, so the day lengths will be identical.

The lowest DLI at Batesville in July was 22.8 mol/m<sup>2</sup> on July 29. In Tokyo, there were 10 days in July with a DLI less than 22.8 mol/m<sup>2</sup>, including 5 days with a DLI less than 10 mol/m<sup>2</sup>. In that context, the cloudiness on July 17 was not exceptional.
