There was a longish discussion about amino acids and [marketing to educated turf pros](https://twitter.com/BIGTurfTeaching/status/1042134023353577477).

I wrote about the analogy of airplane fuel requirements related to [soil test calcium and MLSN](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-09-07-airplane-fuel-requirements-calcium-mlsn/).

Chris Chase took some [pre-typhoon pictures](https://twitter.com/HKChase/status/1039480943134691328):

Jason also wrote about rain and turf growth. I made some calculations related to [nitrogen, rain, and starting point estimates](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-09-12-nitrogen-rain-starting-point-estimates/).

The Walking Greenkeeper, Joe Gulotti, started his [The Talking Greenkeeper](https://twitter.com/hardg43/status/1040693377426227202) podcast.

[The Sodfathers](https://soundcloud.com/user-376549797) started podcasting too. This is from "a couple of turf students with a new podcast coming with a comedic take on the green industry." 

Dave Wilber and Kevin Ross had a [Turfhead Jam Session](https://www.turfnet.com/blogs/entry/1797-turfhead-jam-session-with-kevin-ross-session-number-1/).

I wrote about [shopping for golf magazines at 4 a.m.](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-09-14-shopping-magazines-4am-7-11/), and explained how this particular shopping excursion relates to data about putting surface performance over 6 years.

Video of my presentation about [managing turfgrass diseases in Asia with minimal input](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-09-15-recording-of-my-presentation-about-turf-diseases-in-asia/).

I wrote about [rituals, surrogate markers, and turf performance outcomes](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-09-16-rituals-rather-than-turf-performance-outcomes/). This is about chasing one's tail, or getting results. Not all measurements are useful.
