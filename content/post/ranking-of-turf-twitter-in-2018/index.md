A year ago, I looked at a selection of turfgrass industry accounts and [ranked them](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/turf_twitter_2017/) in the Turf Twitter 2017 analysis based on a combination of followers, tweet creation rate, favorites of the tweets sent from the account, retweets of the tweets sent from the account, and mentions of the account.

I recently repeated this analysis for [Turf Twitter in 2018](https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/turf_twitter_2018/).

The [top 50 "influential" accounts](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/1081322417572655104) for 2018 are here:

Adrian Logue has made a similar analysis and ranking of [golf course architecture Twitter accounts](https://twitter.com/AdrianLogue/status/1077995671720873985).
