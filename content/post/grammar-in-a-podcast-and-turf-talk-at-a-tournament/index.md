Joe Gulotti has invited me onto his The Talking Greenkeeper show for a year-end episode for a few years now. This year he called it "The Micah Woods Annual Holiday Special." 

I was so glad that Joe asked the questions he did, because the answers that made sense to me, to answer those questions, allowed me to explain what I call the grammar of greenkeeping.

This "grammar" is a way of thinking about turfgrass management that makes a lot of sense to me, and it is a concept that I've been working on and trying to understand and to explain. If you would like to hear us discuss this in a way that I don't think I've ever explained it before, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this discussion.

My experience at the Australian Open included all of these." >}}

I've had a chance to work at a lot of golf tournaments over the years. The 2023 Australian Open was my first in Australia, and also the first in which I made a video about it. Golf tournaments provide a great opportunity to talk about turfgrass management. I shared a few of those conversations in this video. It's not so much about the work, and is a bit more about the people and about some of the conversations we had during the week.
