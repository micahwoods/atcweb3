I saw [a video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/221910686) with the question "what is your favorite fertility practice?" That segment starts at the 2:00 mark. 

Then on Twitter I saw some comments about how funny the answers to that question were. I had a laugh because the answers are correct, but it is the question that misuses the word.

I don't expect the turf industry will change its jargon on this. But if one misuses the word *fertility* in conversations with the general public, it should not be a surprise if the responses are about fertility.
