At Real Club de Golf El Prat, host of the 2015 Spanish Open, 3,600 trees fell in a violent windstorm on 9 December 2014. The club has shared [this video](https://vimeo.com/128010201) that shows the scale of the damage, and the impressive work that was done in the aftermath of the storm.

That the playing surfaces were in such fine condition during the tournament, after having to deal with the storm damage and all the disruption that caused, shows the skill and effort of the greenkeeping staff at the club.
