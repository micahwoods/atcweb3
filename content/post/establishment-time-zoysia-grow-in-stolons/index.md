title: 'Establishment time: zoysia grow-in from stolons'

On April 22 I planted some 'Sena' manilagrass with the help of staff from the GolfEast company. We were careful to plant at an exact rate, and we documented the grow-in through digital image analysis. The objective of this project was to measure the grow-in time---that is, how many days would it take after planting at this rate to get full grass coverage.

I made [this video](https://youtu.be/yGbyJI5T4nA) to show the results.

I expect four things will influence the establishment time for manilagrass, assuming it is planted in full sun.

* the grass variety

* the planting rate

* how the grass is managed after planting (topdressing, irrigation, fertilizer, etc.)

* the temperature
