The [ATC Doublecut podcast](https://atc-doublecut.transistor.fm/) has listeners from more than 50 countries around the world. I checked the stats for episode downloads for the past 136 days, from April 1 through August 15, 2022.

I was asked about listeners on a per capita basis. When adjusting for the population of the country, the ranking gets shuffled and a few new countries make the list. Hello Monaco, Iceland, Saint Lucia, and Slovenia!
