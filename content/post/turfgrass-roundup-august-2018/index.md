Wang et al. wrote about research at Rutgers showing the season of topdressing application influences [anthracnose of *Poa annua*](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/aj/first-look/pdf/agronj2018.01.0052.pdf). From the abstract: "Golf turf managers should recognize that autumn topdressing will aid in anthracnose suppression; however, spring applications are more effective when anthracnose is the management objective."

The Hamilton GC Course Maintenance blog had a post about [decreasing organic matter without coring](https://hamiltongcmaintenance.blogspot.com/2018/08/organic-matter-and-other-geeky-stuff.html).
