I was having a discussion about this last week. 

"I think it is a tiny amount," I said, "although sometimes I hear really large amounts when people tell me how much N comes in rain. I'll be sure to look it up." 

I just looked it up, and it is generally a small amount, although there are locations with more.

There are some excellent sources for N deposition data. I looked at:

  * [National Atmospheric Deposition Program](https://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/), USA data
  * [Air Pollution Information System](http://www.apis.ac.uk/), UK data
  * [Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=830), global data

For an example, I downloaded data for Benton County, Oregon, and Garrett County, Maryland. Compared to the amount of N used by grass, or applied as fertilizer in a year, this isn't very much. I'd guess annual N rates would be about 10 to 15 g/m<sup>2</sup> at those locations. Adding 0.1 to 0.3 g N/m<sup>2</sup> would be less than 3% of the annual N rate.

[This guide](http://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/lib/brochures/nitrogenAtmos.pdf) has some maps that show the N deposition by location. There are a few hotspots that may get 20 kg/ha; that could be a substantial amount of N, say 10 to 20% of the annual amount used by the grass.

I looked up data for Tower Bridge in London using the [APIS](http://www.apis.ac.uk/) site. That was an annual total of 15.7 kg N/ha. That will be a substantial amount of N for turf in that location. I'd expect that may be about 20% of the amount a golf course putting green might use in London.
