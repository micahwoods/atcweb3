There is an extraordinary article in the *Green Section Record* by Blake Meentemeyer and Brian Whitlark on turfgrass fertilization. 

You'll want to read [the full article](https://gsrpdf.lib.msu.edu/?file=/article/meentemeyer-whitlark-turfgrass-5-6-16.pdf). It talks about the overall goals of fertilizer application, soil tests, some myth busting, fertilizer and playability, and more. It's a modern article with a lot of historical references too.

The most interesting part of the article for me was the economic case study. A course reduced the putting green fertilizer cost by 82% and the result was "the putting greens have never been healthier." That 82% reduction was from a starting point of a whopping $90,000 USD---that's what was being spent on liquid fertilizer for only 4 acres of greens (16,000 m<sup>2</sup>). Like I said, you'll want to read the full article.
