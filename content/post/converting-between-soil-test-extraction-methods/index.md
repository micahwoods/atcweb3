The MLSN guidelines were developed using a database of soil test results from good performing turf. The Mehlich 3 extractant was used to obtain these results.[^1] That leads to a common question, one that goes something like "I'd like to use MLSN but my soil test was done with a different extractant. Can I still use MLSN? How should I proceed?"

[^1]: The MLSN database does include Olsen (0.5 *M* sodium bicarbonate) and Bray 2 data for phosphorus. You can see these values (6 mg/kg for Olsen, 30 mg/kg for Bray 2) in the [MLSN cheat sheet]({{< relref "/post/new-mlsn-cheat-sheet" >}}) or you can analyze the [MLSN data](https://github.com/micahwoods/2016_mlsn_paper/tree/master/data) for even more details. 

I've answered this question in a number of ways. And in this blog post, I share an excellent resource from Ohio State University.

[ANR-75: Converting between Mehlich-3, Bray P, and Ammonium Acetate Soil Test Values](https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/anr-75).

You can read that document to see conversion values for the Ohio and Indiana region for converting Mehlich 3 potassium, calcium, and magnesium to their expected equivalent amount with an ammonium acetate extraction---or vice versa. And there are also conversions provided between Mehlich 3 and the Bray 1 extraction.

{{< figure src="featured.jpg" caption="My PhD dissertation included research comparing different extraction methods such as Mehlich 3, ammonium acetate, the Morgan (sodium acetate) extractant, and others---it even included a look at nutrient supply rates as measured by [ion-exchange resins](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/publication/woodsetal-2006-ats)---pictured above." >}}

Based on my research, I've recommended in the [MLSN cheat sheet](https://files.asianturfgrass.com/mlsn_cheat_sheet.pdf) to use a factor of 1.2 to convert ammonium acetate K, Ca, and Mg to expected results with a Mehlich 3 extractant. The OSU document (see Table 2) recommends for their regions' soils to use factors of 1.14 for K, 1.15 for Ca, and 1.24 for Mg

There are a couple other options besides trying to convert test results from a different extractant to the expected value had the test been done using Mehlich 3. One option, if you have enough data, is to use your regional data from good-performing turf and the common extraction method in your region to find an MLSN value for soils in your region. Another option is to do [soil tests with Mehlich 3](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/project/soil-tests/).
