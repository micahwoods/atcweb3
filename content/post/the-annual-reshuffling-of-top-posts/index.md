There are hundreds of posts on the ATC website. [Topics](/#tags) range from the [2 green system](/tag/2-green-system/), [aeration](/tag/aeration/), and [algae](/tag/algae/) to [winter](/tag/winter/), [writing](/tag/writing/), and [zoysia](/tag/zoysia/).

Some posts get a lot more views than others, and about once a year I update [this list](/#top-posts) of top posts. 

These aren't just the [posts from the last calendar year](/post/top-10-posts-2023/) that got the most views. No, these are the posts---with no restriction on date of publication---that got the most views in the past two years. It's more like the top posts on the blog of all time, with an extreme weighting toward what's been most read recently.

Without further ado, this is the reshuffle.

These four posts are new additions to the top posts list.

The four posts above are replacing these four.

These four classic posts are off the list. For now at least.

* [Five different ways to measure smoothness and trueness of golf ball roll on putting greens](/post/five-different-ways-to-measure-smoothness-trueness-ball-roll/)
* [An especially lucid abstract about core aeration](/post/core-aeration-lucid-abstract/)
