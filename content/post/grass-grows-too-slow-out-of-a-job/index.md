I was a guest on [The Tie podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/micah-woods-leading-turf-grass-scientist/id1583596139?i=1000643868377) where I spoke with Walker Simas about "Turf for Dummies." Well, not quite to that extreme. We still managed to cover a lot of greenkeeping topics, but perhaps I explained the topics in a less technical way.
