One of my favorite publications is the *The Greenkeeper* annual yearbook by Ikki Publishing Company. 

{{< figure src="featured.jpg" >}}

This yearbook includes annual maintenance summaries for golf courses in Japan. This is a type of practical information that I find really useful.[^1]

[^1]: For example, see [topdressing data]({{< relref "/post/topdressing-japan" >}}) from the 2018 yearbook. 

Sixteen golf courses in the 2016 yearbook provided monthly (and annual) totals for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg added as fertilizer.

I have taken these data from the 16 golf courses and report the median value in the chart below. I have made an adjustment by assuming that the P and K in the yearbook are really P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>O. In the chart, I'm showing P as 44% of the median from the yearbook, and K as 83% of the median from the yearbook.

This is typical (and not just in Japan), to supply more of these nutrients than the grass can use. I often mention this. It's not that I recommend adding so much of these elements, but I point out that it is customary in many parts of the world to apply considerably more P and K and Ca and Mg than the grass can use.

I'd like to point out two things in reference to the chart above.

1. This is ignoring the soil. That is, the 2.4 times more K applied as fertilizer than the grass uses, and the 3.7 time more Ca, and so on, are not even considering that the soil can certainly supply some amount of those elements to the grass.[^2]

[^2]: This is also ignoring the amounts of those elements supplied by irrigation water.

2. The [MLSN method](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/mlsn/) of soil test interpretation accounts for plant use and the soil's ability to supply each element. It doesn't make sense to supply twice as much of an element as the grass can use. If the median course were using MLSN, the amount of fertilizer would be a lot closer to the line of plant use, and for most elements would be *below* the line of plant use because the soil would have ample amounts of those elements.
