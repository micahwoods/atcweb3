The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) has a new series of videos about each of their facilities. I watched [this one](https://youtu.be/_gVpJkr4GAU) about the Manila American Cemetery with special interest.

The [Manila American Cemetery](http://www.abmc.gov/Manila) is the largest of all the overseas cemeteries. The fine lawn areas over the graves are planted to manilagrass, more than 31 hectares (77 acres) of highly maintained lawns that I've [written about before](/post/turfgrass-mystery-where-find-beautiful-grass/) as "the best-maintained large sward of manilagrass in Southeast Asia."

I've visited this cemetery many times over the years. Before I visited for the first time, I'd heard from friends in the Philippines about the quality of the turf there.

I subsequently had a chance to do some advisory work for the ABMC here --- being involved with this cemetery was a tremendous honor, and is one of the favorite projects I've worked on.
