These posts had the most views in 2021. You'll see there are two main topics that were read the most. The top four posts were about organic matter management and coring and that sort of thing. And there were three about playability, or measuring playability. 

Here they are.

[1] January, [No core aeration, no deep verticutting, and surprise! No summer decline]({{< relref "/post/no-summer-decline-core-aeration-deep-verticutting" >}}), in which I reread an article and noticed something I was blind to a decade ago.

[2] March, [You won't believe this common maintenance practice doesn't reduce organic matter at all]({{< relref "/post/this-common-maintenance-practice-does-not-reduce-organic-matter-at-all" >}}), about hollow-tine (coring) cultivation. I had to double check my calculations the first time I worked through this, but after thinking about it, it makes perfect sense.

[3] April, [Organic matter reduction by hollow-tines, solid-tines, and sand topdressing]({{< relref "/post/hollow-tine-solid-topdress-organic-matter" >}}), working through some examples of how OM changes.

[4] May, [An especially lucid abstract about core aeration]({{< relref "/post/core-aeration-lucid-abstract" >}}) that flat out states "that this practice might not be worth doing."

[5] May, [A stimpmeter love story]({{< relref "/post/stimpmeter-love-story" >}}) is an article by Chris Tritabaugh that includes his "list of the things Iâ€™ve learned by stimping multiple greens every day."

[6] January, [A global DLI app]({{< relref "/post/global-dli-app" >}}) that generates a free, downloadable chart of the past year of daily DLI for any location in the world, including weekly and monthly summaries.

[7] May, three reasons [Why I don't worry about infiltration rate]({{< relref "/post/why-i-dont-worry-about-infiltration-rate" >}}).

[8] September, [Five different ways to measure smoothness and trueness of golf ball roll on putting greens]({{< relref "/post/five-different-ways-to-measure-smoothness-trueness-ball-roll" >}}), which introduces a video you can [watch here](https://youtu.be/Fg_aDTB-O10).

[9] December, [A non-comprehensive list of awesome turfgrass things other people did in 2021]({{< relref "/post/awesome-list-2021" >}}). This post has some great stuff in it. 

[10] May, [The Brede Equation]({{< relref "/post/the-brede-equation" >}}) is remarkably effective at speeding up and improving the accuracy of stimpmeter measurements.

{{< figure src="featured.jpg" caption="This screenshot is showing the top 31 posts. There were a lot of interesting topics to write about this year. If you want an easy way to see a list of **all** the posts on the blog, the secret [archive page](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/archive/) is a good one to bookmark." >}}
