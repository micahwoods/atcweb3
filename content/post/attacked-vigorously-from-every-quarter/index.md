title: Attacked vigorously from every quarter
---

"The flagrant merchandising of nostrums and unapproved seeds and materials must be attacked vigorously from every quarter." 

That exhortation was given by the Turf Committee in [their report](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-10-01-turfgrass-twilight-zone/) at the 1952 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Agronomy.

A couple days ago, I received a notification that a [@TurfTruth](https://twitter.com/TurfTruth) account was following me on Twitter. This account is running with that advice, ranking claims or statements on a 1-9 scale of BS, with 1 being no BS and 9 being pure BS. [Check it out](https://twitter.com/TurfTruth). There are a lot of BS 6, 7, and 8's so far.
