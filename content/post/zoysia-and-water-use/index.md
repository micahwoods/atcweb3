I saw an article in the *Global Golf Post* that states zoysiagrass "requires ... less water .. than bermuda[grass]." I guess there's not much [fact-checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking) in golf industry magazines, but that egregious error would have been corrected had the article been fact-checked.

For example, have a look at bermudagrass and zoysiagrass supplied with the same amount of irrigation.[^1]

That's after only 45 days with the restricted irrigation treatment, and it's obvious that bermudagrass is requiring less water than zoysia.

And then a month later,[^2] bermudagrass is still green with limited irrigation, and at this point zoysia has "left the competition."

These grass performed the same with limited irrigation in Florida too.[^3]
