Last year I wrote about a soil temperature turfhack. The soil temperature is [almost always between](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-08-10-soil-temperature-turf-hack/) the day's high and low temperature.

I was at Bangsai Country Club last week to plant some manilagrass (*Zoysia matrella*) for a grow-in experiment. I measured the soil temperature at a 5 cm depth right after planting, and sure enough, it was right in the range predicted by the [#TurfHack](https://twitter.com/hashtag/turfhack?src=hashtag_click).

With these tropical temperatures, I expect this manilagrass to grow in about as fast as it possibly can---the growth certainly won't be limited by temperatures. I'll be monitoring the coverage with some type of digital image analysis. For now I've been using [Canopeo](https://www.canopeoapp.com).

By the way, if you are ever out at Bangsai, it's a great place to see birds. This is the [Asian golden weaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_golden_weaver).
