  caption: "13th green, Grafarholt Course of Reykjavik GC: The Grafarholt Course at Reykjavik GC is the older of the two courses at the largest club in Iceland. It sits in a valley with the sea at Reykjavik visible to the left, and snow covered mountains visible here on a fine late-summer day."

  caption: "fairway undulations caused by frost heaving: One of the challenges at many courses in Iceland is frost heaving, which leaves the ground uneven in the most affected areas. This fairway at Keilir GC shows the result of frost heaving that occurs each winter."

  caption: "Sudernesja GC is a popular course near Keflavik airport, on a beautiful piece of land beside the sea."

  image: wide-open-fairway-at-sudernesja.jpg
  caption: "Sudernesja GC is more open than many of the courses in Iceland, with less lava to capture wayward shots."
- album: iceland
  image: second-green-at-sudurnesja-gc.jpg
  caption: "The 2nd at Sudernesja GC plays down to the ocean. Fairways are primarily fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*), and greens are *Festuca rubra* with *Poa annua*."

  image: ninth-green-at-grindavik-gc.jpg
  caption: "The 9th green at Grindavik GC has lots of contour, requiring a carefully controlled shot to get the ball near the hole. This green sits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary that separates the Eurasian Plate from the North American Plate. The average spreading rate is 2.5 cm per year."

  image: tenth-at-grindavik-gc-and-the-mid-atlantic-ridge.jpg
  caption: "The par four 10th hole at Grindavik GC has a unique natural hazard. The entire right side of the hole, especially pronounced near the green, is a depression from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, also known as the Reykjanes Ridge. This tectonic plate boundary separates the Eurasian Plate from the North American Plate and is moving apart at an average rate of 2.5 cm per year."

  image: 18th-at-grindavik-gc.jpg
  caption: "The 18th at Grindavik GC is a new green and is now all fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*); no *Poa annua* has invaded. The links section of the course is in the background, near the sea at one of Iceland's most popular surfing spots. "

  image: in-the-lava-at-grindavik-gc.jpg
  caption: "At Grindavik GC, one plays some holes on linksland near the ocean, before moving inland, across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, into holes set dramatically into the lava. This grass on this green is fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*), a species of grass especially well-adapted to this climate."

  image: playing-through-the-lava-at-keilir-gc.jpg
  caption: "Keilir GC has a stretch of holes playing through lava, with other holes on more open grassland above the ocean. Wind-driven salt spray can be a particular problem on this section of the course."
- album: iceland
  image: view-from-the-maintenance-building-at-westman-islands-gc.jpg
  caption: "view from the maintenance building at Westman Islands GC: Westman Islands GC sits on an amazing piece of land, and the course plays through natural grassland with a few outcrops of volcanic rock. A few holes out of the frame to the left play through lava along the ocean. At far right is the site of the town festival, held each summer and one of the most popular festivals in Iceland. The grass-roofed stage is seen, with a natural amphitheater behind it."

  caption: "The Korpa course at Reykjavik GC is the newer of the two courses at this club. The Korpa River, known for its salmon runs, twists though the course. Icelandic horses graze in the surrounding pastures."

  caption: "Seltjarnarnes GC with Snæfellsjökull in the background: Seltjarnarnes GC is on a peninsula near Reykjavik. This course is know for the many birds that flock here, and on clear days, the Snæfellsjökull volcano is visible across the sea. Snæfellsjökull was the setting, in the Jules Verne novel [Journey to the Center of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth), in which the protagonists find the entrance to the subterranean passage."

  caption: "The uphill par four 1st at Hveragerdi GC is a blind shot towards active steam vents."
- album: iceland
  image: first-green-at-hveragerdi-gc-icelandic-horses-and-volcanic-activity.jpg
  caption: "Icelandic horses graze in a pasture adjacent to the 1st at Hveragerdi GC. After a recent earthquake, hot gasses came to the surface, killing the grass on about 20% of this green, requiring it to be out of play for one season. "

  caption: "The 2nd at Hveragerdi GC plays downhill with a steam vent to the left. The correct line is well to the right of the steam vent."

  caption: "downhill 2nd at Hveragerdi GC: After successfully navigating past and to the right of the steam vent, one plays downhill to the wide open fairway."

  caption: "Geysir GC is in the town of Geysir, named after the geyser of the same name, and is the root of the English word **geyser**. Strokkur geyser is erupting here."
- album: iceland
  image: green-and-cold-glacial-river-at-geysir-gc.jpg
  caption: "The river running through Geysir GC has no fish. The water is too cold, coming from a nearby glacier. The turf here is fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*). No irrigation is applied to this course, which allows the fescue to thrive and reduces the amount of *Poa annua*."
- album: iceland
  image: riverside-holes-at-geysir-gc.jpg
  caption: "Geysir GC is Iceland's most inland course. It is about 63 km from the ocean. This inland course sits in a landscape unlike any other in the country, where most of the courses are so near the ocean."

  caption: "green and lava at Oddur GC: No artificial hazard or shaping is necessary at this green site, where hills of lava and colorful plants sit right next to the smooth putting surface."

  image: gkg-golf-club-near-reykjavik.jpg
  caption: "GKG Golf Club near Reykjavik: The relatively rich soil at GKG GC results in greener turf and provides a footing for trees to grow. This is a parkland style golf course, a few kilometers from the sea and thus unaffected by salt spray, resulting in a green turf into late September."

I was in Iceland to speak with the Icelandic Green- and Groundskeepers Association about turfgrass nutrient requirements. See my notes about turf in Iceland, along with presentation slides and handout, [here]({{< relref "/post/turfgrass-notes-iceland" >}}).
