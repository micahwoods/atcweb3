  caption: "fairway undulations caused by frost heaving: One of the challenges at many courses in Iceland is frost heaving, which leaves the ground uneven in the most affected areas. This fairway at Keilir GC shows the result of frost heaving that occurs each winter."

  image: second-green-at-sudurnesja-gc.jpg
  caption: "The 2nd at Sudernesja GC plays down to the ocean. Fairways are primarily fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*), and greens are *Festuca rubra* with *Poa annua*."

  image: ninth-green-at-grindavik-gc.jpg
  caption: "The 9th green at Grindavik GC has lots of contour, requiring a carefully controlled shot to get the ball near the hole. This green sits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary that separates the Eurasian Plate from the North American Plate. The average spreading rate is 2.5 cm per year."

  caption: "The par four 10th hole at Grindavik GC has a unique natural hazard. The entire right side of the hole, especially pronounced near the green, is a depression from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, also known as the Reykjanes Ridge. This tectonic plate boundary separates the Eurasian Plate from the North American Plate and is moving apart at an average rate of 2.5 cm per year."

  image: 18th-at-grindavik-gc.jpg
  caption: "The 18th at Grindavik GC is a new green and is now all fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*); no *Poa annua* has invaded. The links section of the course is in the background, near the sea at one of Iceland's most popular surfing spots. "

  image: in-the-lava-at-grindavik-gc.jpg
  caption: "At Grindavik GC, one plays some holes on linksland near the ocean, before moving inland, across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, into holes set dramatically into the lava. This grass on this green is fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*), a species of grass especially well-adapted to this climate."
- album: Iceland
  image: playing-through-the-lava-at-keilir-gc.jpg
  caption: "Keilir GC has a stretch of holes playing through lava, with other holes on more open grassland above the ocean. Wind-driven salt spray can be a particular problem on this section of the course."

  caption: "view from the maintenance building at Westman Islands GC: Westman Islands GC sits on an amazing piece of land, and the course plays through natural grassland with a few outcrops of volcanic rock. A few holes out of the frame to the left play through lava along the ocean. At far right is the site of the town festival, held each summer and one of the most popular festivals in Iceland. The grass-roofed stage is seen, with a natural amphitheater behind it."

This course is know for the many birds that flock here, and on clear days, the Snæfellsjökull volcano is visible across the sea. Snæfellsjökull was the setting, in the Jules Verne novel [Journey to the Center of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth), in which the protagonists find the entrance to the subterranean passage."

  caption: "Icelandic horses graze in a pasture adjacent to the 1st at Hveragerdi GC. After a recent earthquake, hot gasses came to the surface, killing the grass on about 20% of this green, requiring it to be out of play for one season. "

  caption: "The river running through Geysir GC has no fish. The water is too cold, coming from a nearby glacier. The turf here is fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*). No irrigation is applied to this course, which allows the fescue to thrive and reduces the amount of *Poa annua*."

  image: riverside-holes-at-geysir-gc.jpg
  caption: "Geysir GC is Iceland's most inland course. It is about 63 km from the ocean. This inland course sits in a landscape unlike any other in the country, where most of the courses are so near the ocean."

  caption: "GKG Golf Club near Reykjavik: The relatively rich soil at GKG GC results in greener turf and provides a footing for trees to grow. This is a parkland style golf course, a few kilometers from the sea and thus unaffected by salt spray, resulting in a green turf into late September."

I was in Iceland to speak with the Icelandic Green- and Groundskeepers Association about turfgrass nutrient requirements. Read more about the seminar, and download the presentation slides and handout, in [this report]({{< relref "/post/method-for-estimating-turfgrass-nutrient-requirements-iceland-report" >}}) about a method for estimating turfgrass nutrient requirements.

This is a quick summary report of interesting things I noted on this trip, along with a gallery of annotated photos. Click any of the photos to open the gallery.

* The association were most hospitable, allowing me to visit 11 golf courses on this trip, along with other botanical expeditions to geysers, waterfalls, ocean cliffs, volcanic craters, and lawns.

* There are 70 golf courses in Iceland. The population is 320,000. Many people are surprised that there are so many courses.&#0160;

* The courses here are at 63 to 66° N. The temperature, however, is moderated by the [Gulf Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream). It is relatively cool, but not exceedingly cold, and fine fescue (*Festuca rubra*) thrives here.

{{< figure library="true" src="gullfoss.jpg" title="Lots of fine fescue and other grasses growing at majestic Gullfoss." >}}

* For a look at how temperatures in Reykjavik may influence turf growth and nitrogen requirement, see the [growth potential document](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/201306_growth_potential.pdf) which includes figures and charts about growth potential of Reykjavik in comparison to other world cities. In summary, Reykjavik has a short growing season.
  
* In mown, irrigated, and fertilized turf, *Poa annua* can grow well also. Turfgrass managers in Iceland are trying to encourage the growth of *Festuca* and discourage the growth of *Poa*.

* Because most of the courses are near the ocean, salt spray can be a problem in discoloring and reducing the growth rate of the grass. Geysir GC, 63 km from the sea, is the most inland course in the country.

* Keilir GC golf course manager and Green- and Groundskeeper Association board member Bjarni Þór Hannesson is a member of the critically acclaimed band [**worm is green**](http://www.wormisgreen.com/). They've toured in China, Eastern Europe, and the United States, and I recommend going to a show if they are ever in your area. Or buy some albums.

* Iceland and its grasses and golf courses are fascinating. Do visit if you ever have a chance. It is a convenient stop when traveling between the United States and Europe.
