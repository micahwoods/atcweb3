There is so much work done to manage the organic matter right around the soil surface---and much of that work is disruptive. Hollow-tine cultivation (coring), scarification and verticutting, sand topdressing: sometimes these are essential, but ideally one will minimize them because they are disruptive. So how to get it right? Measuring exactly how much organic matter is present, and how it has changed over time, gives all the information you need to adjust the work, and the surfaces, to be exactly as you want them.

This stands for **O**rganic **M**atter at a depth of 0 to **2** cm, where 0 is the soil surface; 2 to **4** cm, and 4 to **6** cm. **OM246**.
