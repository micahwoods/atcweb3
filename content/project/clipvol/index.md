When I was a golf course superintendent in Japan, we collected clipping volume. But I didn't pay much attention to it. In 2013, I became intrigued[^1] by the relationship between clipping volume and green speed. When the grass was producing fewer clippings, the stimpmeter measurement was faster. "But of course it would be faster," we all might realize. But that was how I got started with this. 

[^1]: See my blog post [More about the measurement of grass clippings](https://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2014/08/more-about-the-measurement-of-grass-clippings.html) for a bit of the backstory.

Then I started to wonder if the dry weight of clippings (the *clipping yield*) could be estimated from the volume. Because if it could, then clipping volume would be an easy way to estimate nutrient harvest.

It turns out, clipping volume is way more useful, and easier to implement, than I ever though it would be.
