We do soil tests for clients around the world. Contact me if you want to know more.

We also do a lot of research in this area. We developed the MLSN guidelines, have been studying spatial variability and sampling techniques, and my Ph.D. research was all about soil testing methods and nutrient availability in sand rootzones.
