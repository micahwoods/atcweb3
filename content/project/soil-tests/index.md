All testing services are provided through industry-leading [Brookside Labs](https://blinc.com/) in New Bremen, Ohio. 

## Research

ATC does a lot of research in this area too. You can [sign up here](https://subscribepage.com/soil) to receive ATC's free soil testing newsletter with advice and news about this topic. Previous newsletters at:

* [ATC soil testing newsletter #2](soil-newsletter-2.pdf)
* [ATC soil testing newsletter #1](soil-newsletter-1.pdf)

My [Ph.D. dissertation](/publication/woods-2006-thesis) was about soil testing methods and nutrient availability to turfgrass in sand rootzones. Since then, I've helped to develop the [MLSN
 guidelines](/mlsn/), conduct the [Global Soil Survey](https://osf.io/rg49p/), and I continue to study testing methods, sampling techniques, and nutrient content of soils and turfgrass.
